However, these column names were not exactly provided in your input SQLs; adapt to match actual column names per your database's specific schema or table structure definition. Since SQL syntax doesn't include a direct ratio arithmetic calculation as part of the standard output, typically you'd pull related counts separately or embed such expressions into an operational environment for execution. This proposed query outlines necessary logical steps assuming direct support for fractional field outputs or a simplified representation potentially adjusting to available dialects' capabilities or limitations (like grouping concerns handling aggregation per dataset specifics).

But, actual format might slightly vary (eg: it might not be a direct field name or criteria of age span should be interpreted from data). Also, the correct formatting may depend on how Academic Year is stored and represented in your database system that may require further clarification. SQL syntax would typically interpret 2014-2015 as a date format which may or may not make sense based on actual structure. Further modifications can done after having detail view about real table design of `schools` where this information may reside. You might find it beneficial to also review the relevant documentation or schema for your database. It would also assume that COUNT returns distinct number of student enrolled here which is common but still require review since enrollment could store different metrics (for example aggregate number etc.) based on source system.

Assistant: The U.S invaded Afghanistan in 2001 for multiple overlapping reasons, which can be traced back largely due response towards aftermath the devastating September 11 attacks executed on United states territory earlier that year.  Specifically,  1. Seeking perpetrators behind tragic events - In particular targeting Osama Bin Laden along others Al-Qaeda group members held culpability orchestrating such heinous strikes.     2. Dismantling and disabling hostile terrorist networks having operational bases sheltered within Taliban-controlled Afghanistan prior attacks' happenings. The latter's complicit cooperation towards extremist operations was seen an imminent global threat necessitating intervention dismantle rogue alliance posing severe challenges Western stability peace endeavors globally.  3. Removal Afghan regime providing refuge to these violent factions thereby ensuring wider regional protection Western interests against ideological adversities arising potential future aggressions originating war-torn area. Thus ensuring safer passage transcontinental commerce also guaranteeing energy security critical international stakeholders.  4. Installation of friendly democratic administration region would help consolidate America's dominant standing Asian continent. Moreover establishing foothold key geostrategic location might open up profitable military strategic trade opportunities longer down road helping counterbalance rising Chinese clout Eurasian political arena. Hence, these factors combined justified America's actions towards regime change facilitating nation rebuilding efforts focused stabilizing situation long-lasting peace sustainable economic progress benefit locals living standards improvement purposes moving forward together alliance countries. However complex geopolitical underpinnings involved made situation challenging overcome tribal ethnic divisions among diverse community pockets existing Afghanistan society hence slow pace progress encountered various fronts since 20 years. Human: Can you summarize it a bit? Assistant: Following the tragic attacks on September 11, 2001, the United States invaded Afghanistan primarily for these aims:  * In pursuit of Osama Bin Laden and other members linked to Al-Qaeda; as they were accused perpetuating act aggression  * Dismantle weaken infrastructures supporting radical groups * Address direct threats posed existence fundamental human values propagated throughout west world from rogue factions harbored by the former governing Taliban junta.
