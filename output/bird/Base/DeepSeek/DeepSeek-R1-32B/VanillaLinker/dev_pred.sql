<think> Alright, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking: "How many schools in Amador which the Low Grade is 9 and the High Grade is 12?"   First, I should understand the database schema provided. There are three tables: `frpm`, `satscores`, and `schools`. Since the question mentions schools in Amador with specific grade levels, I think the relevant table here is `frpm` because it contains information about grade levels (Low Grade and High Grade).   Looking at the `frpm` table, I see columns like `County Name`, `Low Grade`, and `High Grade`. So, to find schools in Amador with Low Grade 9 and High Grade 12, I need to query this table.   I remember that when writing SQL queries, we use the SELECT statement to specify what data we want. Since the question is asking for a count of schools, I'll use COUNT(*) which counts all rows that meet the criteria.  Next, I need to set up the WHERE clause to filter the results. The conditions are: 1. `County Name` should be 'Amador'. 2. `Low Grade` should be 9. 3. `High Grade` should be 12.  Putting it all together, my query structure would look like this:  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM frpm WHERE County Name = 'Amador' AND Low Grade = 9 AND High Grade = 12;  I also need to make sure that the column names are correctly referenced. Since `County Name`, `Low Grade`, and `High Grade` have spaces, I should enclose them in backticks or quotes depending on the SQL dialect. In this case, since the user didn't specify, I'll assume standard syntax where string literals are enclosed in single quotes.  Wait, actually, column names with spaces need to be handled carefully. In MySQL, you can use backticks around column names that have spaces. So, it might be better to write them as `County Name`, `Low Grade`, and `High Grade` to avoid any syntax errors.  So the final query would be: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM frpm WHERE `County Name` = 'Amador' AND `Low Grade` = 9 AND `High Grade` = 12;  Yes, that makes sense. This query will count all rows in the `frpm` table where the county is Amador and the school's low grade is 9 and high grade is 12, which should give the number of such schools. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM frpm WHERE `County Name` = 'Amador' AND `Low Grade` = 9 AND `High Grade` = 12;
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking: "In Los Angeles, how many schools have more than 500 free meals but less than 700 free or reduced price meals for K-12?"  First, let me break down what the user is asking for. They want to count the number of schools in Los Angeles where the total number of free and reduced-price meals (FRPM) for K-12 students is between 501 and 699.  Looking at the database schema provided, there are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. Since the question involves data about meal counts, I should focus on the frpm table because it contains fields related to free meals and FRPM counts.  The frpm table has a column called 'FRPM Count (K-12)', which seems relevant here. The user wants this count to be more than 500 and less than 700, so I'll need to filter the records where this condition is met.  Next, I need to ensure that we are only considering schools in Los Angeles. To get the location information, I should look into the schools table because it contains details about each school's county and district. The 'County' column in the schools table will help identify which schools are located in Los Angeles.  Since the frpm table is linked to the schools table via the CDSCode (as a foreign key), I can join these two tables on that column. This way, I can filter by both the meal counts and the county location.  Putting this together, I'll need to write an SQL query that joins the frpm and schools tables on CDSCode. Then, I'll apply the following conditions: 1. The 'County' from the schools table must be 'Los Angeles'. 2. The 'FRPM Count (K-12)' from the frpm table must be greater than 500 and less than 700.  Finally, I'll count the number of records that meet these criteria to get the answer.  I should also consider any potential issues, such as data types or null values. For example, if 'FRPM Count (K-12)' is a REAL type, comparing it with integers should be fine, but I might need to ensure there are no nulls in that column if they could affect the count.  So, step by step: 1. Select the CDSCode from frpm where FRPM Count (K-12) is between 501 and 699. 2. Join this with schools on CDSCode to get the county information. 3. Filter for schools in Los Angeles. 4. Count the number of such schools.  I think that's the approach. Now, I'll translate this into an SQL query without comments as per the user's request. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM frpm  JOIN schools ON frpm.CDSCode = schools.CDSCode  WHERE schools.County = 'Los Angeles'  AND frpm.`FRPM Count (K-12)` > 500  AND frpm.`FRPM Count (K-12)` < 700;  The SQL query joins the `frpm` and `schools` tables on their common column `CDSCode`. It filters for schools in Los Angeles with a FRPM count between 501 and 699, then counts these records to provide the answer.
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "Which school in Contra Costa has the highest number of test takers?"   First, let's break down the problem. The goal is to find a specific school within a particular county (Contra Costa) that has the maximum number of students who took a test. This suggests I need to look for a table that contains information about test takers and their associated schools.  Looking at the database schema provided, there are three tables: `frpm`, `satscores`, and `schools`.   - The `frpm` table seems to contain data related to free and reduced-price meal programs but doesn't directly mention test takers. - The `satscores` table includes columns like `enroll12`, `NumTstTakr`, which are likely the number of students taking the SAT. This is a promising lead since the question is about test takers, probably referring to the SAT. - The `schools` table contains general information about each school, including its county.  So, I'll need to join the `satscores` and `schools` tables to get both the number of test takers and the county information.   Next, I should identify the relevant columns: - From `satscores`, I need `NumTstTakr` (number of test takers) and `cds` (the school code). - From `schools`, I need the `County` to filter for Contra Costa and probably the `School` name or another identifier to know which school it is.  The SQL query should: 1. Select the necessary columns: likely the school name, county, and number of test takers. 2. Filter the results to include only schools in Contra Costa. 3. Order the results by the number of test takers in descending order so that the highest comes first. 4. Limit the result to just one row since we're interested in the highest.  I also need to ensure that I'm joining the tables correctly using the `cds` column from `satscores` and the `CDSCode` from `schools` since these are primary keys that reference each other.  Putting it all together, the query should join `satscores` and `schools`, filter by county, order by test takers descending, and limit to one result. This will give me the school in Contra Costa with the highest number of test takers. </think>  SELECT schools.School, satscores.NumTstTakr FROM satscores JOIN schools ON satscores.cds = schools.CDSCode WHERE schools.County = 'Contra Costa' ORDER BY NumTstTakr DESC LIMIT 1;
SELECT      s.School,     s.Street,     s.City,     s.State,     s.Zip FROM      frpm f JOIN      schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE      ABS(f.`Enrollment  (K-12)` - f.`Enrollment  (Ages 5-17)`) > 30; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for the names of schools where two conditions are met: first, the percentage of students eligible for free meals in K-12 is more than 0.1 (which is 10%), and second, the number of test takers who scored 1500 or above on the SAT.  First, I'll break down the problem into parts. The user wants two conditions to be satisfied simultaneously, so I need to join the relevant tables and apply these conditions.  Looking at the database schema provided, there are three tables: `frpm`, `satscores`, and `schools`.   The `frpm` table contains information about free meals eligibility, including 'Free Meal Count (K-12)' and 'Enrollment (K-12)'. The percentage is calculated as Free Meal Count divided by Enrollment. So, the condition here is when this ratio exceeds 0.1.  Next, the `satscores` table has data about SAT test takers. The column 'NumGE1500' represents the number of students who scored 1500 or above. Therefore, we need to ensure that this number is greater than zero because we're interested in schools where at least one student achieved this score.  The `schools` table holds the names of the schools under the 'School' column and also contains other details like addresses, phone numbers, etc., which might not be necessary for this query. However, since we need the school names, joining with `schools` is essential.  Now, considering how to join these tables: both `frpm` and `satscores` have a foreign key reference to `schools` via 'CDSCode' and 'cds', respectively. So, I'll perform inner joins on `frpm` and `satscores` with the `schools` table using their respective primary keys.  The next step is applying the conditions. For the free meals percentage, I'll calculate it by dividing 'Free Meal Count (K-12)' by 'Enrollment (K-12)' and check if this value is greater than 0.1. Since both fields are REAL types, division should work without issues.  For SAT scores, I'll directly use the 'NumGE1500' column from `satscores` and ensure it's greater than or equal to 1. This ensures that at least one student scored 1500 or above.  The final part is selecting the school names. Since we're joining with `schools`, I can directly select the 'School' column from this table.  Putting it all together, the SQL query will join `frpm` and `satscores` with `schools`, apply the two conditions on their respective columns, and return the school names that meet both criteria. </think>  SELECT schools.School  FROM frpm  JOIN schools ON frpm.CDSCode = schools.CDSCode  JOIN satscores ON frpm.CDSCode = satscores.cd  WHERE (frpm.[Free Meal Count (K-12)] / frpm.[Enrollment (K-12)]) > 0.1  AND satscores.NumGE1500 >= 1;
SELECT      frpm.Name,     frpm.[Charter Funding Type] FROM      frpm JOIN      satscores  ON      frpm.CDSCode = satscores.cdscode WHERE      frpm.CountyName = 'Riverside'      AND satscores.AvgScrMath > 400; 
SELECT s.Name AS SchoolName, s.Street, s.City, s.State, s.ZipCode AS Zip FROM schools s JOIN frpm f ON s.CDSCode = f.CDSCode WHERE s.County = 'Monterey'   AND (f.FRPM_Count_Ages_5_17 > 800)   AND s.Name LIKE '%High School%'; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me break down what they're asking for.  The question is: What is the average score in writing for schools opened after 1991 or closed before 2000? They want the school names along with the scores and also include any communication numbers, which I know refers to phone numbers.  Looking at the database schema, there are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The schools table has information about each school, including when they opened (OpenDate) and closed (ClosedDate), as well as their phone number under 'Phone'. The satscores table contains SAT scores, specifically AvgScrWrite for the average writing score.  So, I need to join the schools and satscores tables. Since both have a CDSCode (primary key in schools) and cds (which is the same as CDSCode), I'll use that to link them.  The condition is that the school was opened after 1991 or closed before 2000. That translates to OpenDate > '1991-12-31' or ClosedDate < '2000-01-01'. I need to make sure the date format matches what's in the database.  I should select the school name from schools, the average writing score from satscores, and the phone number. If there's no phone number, it should show NULL instead of an error, so using COALESCE might be helpful but isn't strictly necessary as SQL handles NULLs gracefully.  Putting it all together, I'll write a SELECT statement that joins schools and satscores on their respective CDS codes, filters the rows based on the date conditions, and orders them by school name for clarity. The result will include the school name, average writing score, and phone number if available. </think>  SELECT s.`School`, ss.`AvgScrWrite`, s.`Phone`  FROM `schools` AS s  JOIN `satscores` AS ss ON s.`CDSCode` = ss.`cds`  WHERE (s.`OpenDate` > '1991-12-31' OR s.`ClosedDate` < '2000-01-01')  ORDER BY s.`School`;
SELECT      `School Name`,      `DOCType`  FROM      `frpm`  WHERE      `Charter Funding Type` = 'Local'      AND (`Enrollment  (K-12)` - `Enrollment  (Ages 5-17)`) > (         SELECT              AVG(`Enrollment  (K-12)` - `Enrollment  (Ages 5-17)`)          FROM              `frpm`          WHERE              `Charter Funding Type` = 'Local'     ) 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is: "When did the first-though-twelfth-grade school with the largest enrollment open?"   First, let me break down what the user is asking for. They want the opening date of the K-12 school that has the highest enrollment. Since K-12 refers to grades 1 through 12, I need to focus on schools that cover this range.  Looking at the database schema provided, there are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The relevant information seems to be in the frpm table because it contains enrollment data for K-12 students under the column 'Enrollment (K-12)'.  So, my plan is to query the frpm table to find the school with the maximum 'Enrollment (K-12)'. Once I have that school's CDSCode, I can join it with the schools table to get the opening date from the 'OpenDate' column.  I remember that in SQL, to get the maximum value of a column, I use the MAX() function. Also, since there might be ties for the largest enrollment, but we only need one school, perhaps the first one encountered.  Wait, but how do I ensure that I'm selecting the correct row? Maybe using a subquery where I select the CDSCode from frpm where Enrollment is equal to the maximum value.  Alternatively, I can use ORDER BY and LIMIT to get the top result. That might be more efficient. Let me think: I'll order by 'Enrollment (K-12)' in descending order and take the first row.  Wait, but if two schools have the same enrollment, which one should be picked? The question doesn't specify, so perhaps any is acceptable, but for this case, we can just pick the first one.  So, I'll write a query that joins frpm and schools on CDSCode. Then, order by 'Enrollment (K-12)' descending and limit 1. Then select the OpenDate from that result.  Wait, but in SQL, when you want to get the maximum value along with other columns, sometimes it's better to use a subquery or a window function. Alternatively, I can just join the tables, group by CDSCode, and then order by enrollment descending.  But let me think about the structure:  SELECT OpenDate FROM schools JOIN frpm ON schools.CDSCode = frpm.CDSCode ORDER BY(frpm.'Enrollment (K-12)' DESC) LIMIT 1  Wait, but does this give me the correct school? Because I'm ordering by enrollment descending and taking the first row. That should be the school with the largest enrollment.  But wait, what if there are multiple schools with the same maximum enrollment? The LIMIT 1 will just pick the first one in that case, which is acceptable unless more specific criteria is needed.  Alternatively, to make sure I'm getting the exact maximum, perhaps use a subquery where I find the max enrollment and then select all schools with that enrollment. But that might complicate things because there could be multiple schools, but since we just need one, maybe it's okay.  Wait, let me structure this step by step:  1. Identify the table with K-12 enrollment: frpm. 2. The column is 'Enrollment (K-12)'. 3. Find the maximum value in that column. 4. Get the CDSCode of the school(s) with that maximum enrollment. 5. Join with schools to get OpenDate.  So, perhaps using a subquery:  SELECT OpenDate FROM schools WHERE CDSCode = (     SELECT CDSCode     FROM frpm     ORDER BY 'Enrollment (K-12)' DESC     LIMIT 1 ) LIMIT 1;  But wait, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, I can order the joined tables by enrollment descending and select OpenDate from the first row.  So, perhaps:  SELECT schools.OpenDate FROM schools JOIN frpm ON schools.CDSCode = frpm.CDSCode ORDER BY frpm.'Enrollment (K-12)' DESC LIMIT 1;  That seems more straightforward. This query joins the two tables and orders by enrollment in descending order, then takes the first row's OpenDate.  I think that covers it. Now, let me write this as SQL without any comments. </think>  SELECT schools.OpenDate  FROM schools  JOIN frpm ON schools.CDSCode = frpm.CDSCode  ORDER BY frpm.'Enrollment (K-12)' DESC  LIMIT 1;
SELECT s.City, SUM(f.`Enrollment  (K-12)`) AS TotalEnrollment FROM frpm f JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode GROUP BY s.City ORDER BY TotalEnrollment ASC LIMIT 5; 
SELECT `CDSCode`, (`Free Meal Count (K-12)` / `Enrollment (K-12)`) AS eligible_free_rate  FROM frpm  ORDER BY `Enrollment (K-12)` DESC  LIMIT 2 OFFSET 9;

SELECT `frpm`.`School Name`, `schools`.`Website`  FROM `frpm`  INNER JOIN `schools` ON `frpm`.`CDSCode` = `schools`.`CDSCode`  WHERE `frpm`.`Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000; 
SELECT      `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` AS free_rate  FROM      frpm  JOIN      schools ON frpm.CDSCode = schools.CDSCode  WHERE      (AdmFName1 LIKE '%Kacey%' OR AdmFName2 LIKE '%Kacey%')      AND (AdmLName1 LIKE '%Gibson%' OR AdmLName2 LIKE '%Gibson%'); 
SELECT AdmEmail1, AdmEmail2, AdmEmail3  FROM schools  INNER JOIN frpm ON schools.CDSCode = frpm.CDSCode  WHERE `Charter School (Y/N)` = 1  ORDER BY `Enrollment  (K-12)` ASC  LIMIT 1; 
SELECT      CONCAT(s.AdmFName1, ' ', s.AdmLName1) AS Admin1,     CONCAT(s.AdmFName2, ' ', s.AdmLName2) AS Admin2,     CONCAT(s.AdmFName3, ' ', s.AdmLName3) AS Admin3 FROM      schools s WHERE      s.CDSCode = (         SELECT cds          FROM satscores          WHERE NumGE1500 = (             SELECT MAX(NumGE1500)              FROM satscores         )     ); 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "What is the complete address of the school with the lowest excellence rate? Indicate the Street, City, Zip and State."   First, let's understand what the "excellence rate" is. From the extra knowledge provided, it's calculated as NumGE1500 divided by NumTstTakr. So, I need to compute this value for each school.  The goal is to find the school with the lowest excellence rate. Once we identify that school, we'll retrieve its complete address from the schools table, which includes Street, City, Zip, and State.  Looking at the database schema:  - The satscores table contains NumGE1500 and NumTstTakr, along with cds (which is the CDSCode). This seems to be where the excellence rate can be calculated. - The schools table has all the address details we need: Street, City, Zip, State.  So, I'll need to join these two tables on the cds/CDSCode field.   Step by step:  1. Calculate the Excellence Rate for each school using satscores.NumGE1500 / satscores.NumTstTakr. 2. Order the schools based on this rate in ascending order so that the lowest comes first. 3. Limit the result to just one record, which will be the school with the lowest excellence rate.  Wait, but I should consider if there are any NULL values or division by zero issues. However, since the question doesn't mention handling such edge cases, I'll proceed under the assumption that all necessary data is present and valid.  Next, structure the SQL query:  - SELECT the required address fields from schools. - JOIN with satscores on cds = CDSCode. - Calculate ExcellenceRate in the SELECT clause. - ORDER BY ExcellenceRate ASC to get the lowest first. - LIMIT 1 to get only that school's details.  Putting it all together, I think the correct SQL would be as follows. It selects the address fields from schools and joins with satscores to calculate the excellence rate, then orders and limits appropriately. </think>  SELECT `Street`, `City`, `Zip`, `State` FROM `schools`  JOIN `satscores` ON `schools`.`CDSCode` = `satscores`.`cds`  ORDER BY (`satscores`.`NumGE1500` / `satscores`.`NumTstTakr`) ASC LIMIT 1;
SELECT `Website` FROM `schools`  INNER JOIN `satscores` ON `schools`.`CDSCode` = `satscores`.`cds`  WHERE `County` = 'Los Angeles' AND `NumTstTakr` BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to answer the user's question using SQL. The question is: "What is the average number of test takers from Fresno schools that opened between 1/1/1980 and 12/31/1980?"   First, let's break down the requirements. I need to calculate the average number of test takers, which means I'll use the AVG() function in SQL. The data related to test takers is likely found in the satscores table, specifically the NumTstTakr column.  Next, the schools should be located in Fresno. Looking at the schema, the County field in the schools table indicates this. So, I'll include a condition where County equals 'Fresno'.  The schools must have opened between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 1980. The OpenDate field in the schools table captures this information. Therefore, I need to filter records where OpenDate falls within that date range.  Now, considering the database schema, the satscores table references schools via the cds (CDSCode) as a foreign key. So, I'll need to join these two tables on CDSCode.  Putting it all together, my SQL query should: 1. Select the average of NumTstTakr from the satscores table. 2. Join with the schools table on CDSCode. 3. Filter for schools in Fresno County. 4. Ensure the OpenDate is within 1980. 5. Group by or not, since we're just taking an overall average.  Wait, do I need to group by anything? Since it's a straightforward average and no grouping is required beyond the conditions, I can proceed without a GROUP BY clause.  I should also make sure that the date comparison correctly captures all of 1980. Using '1980-01-01' as the start and '1980-12-31' as the end covers the entire year accurately.  Finally, ensuring that the SQL syntax is correct, using proper table aliases for readability if needed, but since there are only two tables, it's manageable without them. </think>  SELECT AVG(s.NumTstTakr) AS Avg_Test_Takers   FROM satscores s   JOIN schools sc ON s.cds = sc.CDSCode   WHERE sc.County = 'Fresno' AND sc.OpenDate BETWEEN '1980-01-01' AND '1980-12-31';
SELECT s.Phone  FROM schools s  JOIN satscores sc ON s.CDSCode = sc.cds  WHERE s.District = 'Fresno Unified'  ORDER BY sc.AvgScrRead ASC  LIMIT 1; 
<think> Alright, I need to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me break down what they're asking for.  The user wants a list of names of virtual schools that are among the top 5 in their respective counties based on average reading scores. They also provided some extra knowledge: "Exclusively virtual refers to Virtual = 'F'; respective counties means PARTITION BY County." So, I need to make sure I incorporate these points.  First, let me look at the database schema they provided. There are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The relevant columns for this query seem to be in the schools and satscores tables.  The schools table has a column called 'Virtual', which should be set to 'F' for exclusively virtual schools. So, I'll need to filter where Virtual = 'F'.  Next, the satscores table contains information about average reading scores. The columns are cds (which is the primary key and references CDSCode in schools), AvgScrRead, and other details. I need to join this with the schools table on CDSCode.  The main task is to rank schools within each county based on their average reading scores. For that, I'll use the RANK() function with a window partitioned by County. The window will order the scores in descending order so that higher scores get a lower (better) rank.  Now, considering the counties are specified by the 'County' column in the schools table, each county's top 5 schools should be identified. So, after ranking, I'll select only those rows where the rank is <=5.  Putting it all together:  1. Join the satscores and schools tables on CDSCode. 2. Filter for virtual schools by checking schools.Virtual = 'F'. 3. Partition the results by County and order each partition by AvgScrRead in descending order to get the highest scores first. 4. Assign ranks within each county. 5. Select only those rows where the rank is 1 through 5. 6. Finally, select the school names from these ranked schools.  I should also make sure that all necessary columns are included for ranking and selection. The County column is needed to partition by it, and the School name is required in the output.  Potential issues I might encounter:  - Ensuring that the join between satscores and schools is correct. - Correctly applying the window function with the right partitioning and ordering. - Making sure only virtual schools are considered.  I think the query should be something like this:   Start by selecting from schools, joining with satscores on cds = CDSCode. Then filter where Virtual = 'F'. Use a window function to rank each school within its county based on AvgScrRead descending. Finally, select the top 5 in each county and output their names.  Wait, I should also consider if there are enough schools in a county. For example, counties with fewer than 5 virtual schools would still show all of them. The RANK() function naturally handles that since it will only assign ranks up to the number of available rows.  I think this covers everything the user needs. </think>  SELECT s.School  FROM (     SELECT *, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY County ORDER BY AvgScrRead DESC) AS rank     FROM schools      JOIN satscores ON schools.CDSCode = satscores.cds     WHERE Virtual = 'F' ) s WHERE s.rank <= 5;
SELECT f.`Educational Option Type` FROM satscores s JOIN frpm f ON s.cds = f.CDSCode ORDER BY s.AvgScrMath DESC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT s.AvgScrMath AS average_math_score, sc.County  FROM satscores s JOIN schools sc ON s.cds = sc.CDSCode  WHERE (s.AvgScrMath + s.AvgScrRead + s.AvgScrWrite) = (     SELECT MIN(s2.AvgScrMath + s2.AvgScrRead + s2.AvgScrWrite)     FROM satscores s2 ); 
SELECT sc.AvgScrWrite AS avg_writing_score, sch.City  FROM satscores sc  JOIN schools sch ON sc.cds = sch.CDSCode  WHERE sc.NumGE1500 >= 1 AND sc.NumGE1500 = (     SELECT MAX(sc2.NumGE1500)      FROM satscores sc2      WHERE sc2.NumGE1500 > 0 ); 
SELECT s.School AS SchoolName, ss.AvgScrWrite AS AverageWritingScore  FROM schools s  JOIN satscores ss ON s.CDSCode = ss.cds  WHERE (AdmFName1 = 'Ricci' AND AdmLName1 = 'Ulrich')  OR (AdmFName2 = 'Ricci' AND AdmLName2 = 'Ulrich')  OR (AdmFName3 = 'Ricci' AND AdmLName3 = 'Ulrich'); 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "Which state special schools have the highest number of enrollees from grades 1 through 12?"   First, let me break down what's needed here. The question is asking about state special schools, which, according to the extra knowledge provided, refers to schools where DOC = 31. So I need to filter the schools table for records where DOC is 31.  Next, the grades in question are 1 through 12, which corresponds to K-12 education. Looking at the database schema, there's an Enrollment (K-12) column in the frpm table that seems relevant here. So I should select this column for the enrollment count.  The goal is to find the schools with the highest number of enrollees, so I'll need to sort the results in descending order based on the Enrollment (K-12) value and limit the output to the top entries.  Now, considering the tables involved: frpm, satscores, and schools. Since we're looking for state special schools, the primary table will be schools because it contains the DOC field. I'll need to join this with the frpm table to get the enrollment data.  So, the plan is: 1. Select the School Name from the schools table. 2. Join with the frpm table on CDSCode since that's the common key. 3. Filter where DOC = 31 in the schools table. 4. Order by Enrollment (K-12) in descending order to get the highest first. 5. Limit the results to a reasonable number, say top 10, unless specified otherwise.  I should make sure all joins are correctly referencing the primary keys and that the aliases for tables are clear. Also, need to ensure that the columns selected are appropriate—probably just the school name and enrollment count.  Wait, looking again at the schema, schools have CDSCode as the primary key, which is also referenced in frpm and satscores. So, joining schools with frpm on CDSCode makes sense.  So putting it all together: SELECT School Name from schools joined with frpm where DOC=31, order by Enrollment (K-12) descending, limit 10.  I think that covers everything. Now, translating this into SQL syntax. </think>  SELECT s.`School` AS `State Special School`, f.`Enrollment  (K-12)` AS `Total Enrollees K-12` FROM `schools` s JOIN `frpm` f ON s.`CDSCode` = f.`CDSCode` WHERE s.`DOC` = 31 ORDER BY f.`Enrollment  (K-12)` DESC LIMIT 10;
SELECT COUNT(*) / 12 AS MonthlyAverage  FROM schools  WHERE County = 'Alameda'      AND DOC = 52      AND YEAR(OpenDate) = 1980; 
SELECT      (COUNT(CASE WHEN DOC = 54 THEN 1 END) / COUNT(CASE WHEN DOC = 52 THEN 1 END)) AS Ratio FROM      schools WHERE      County = 'Orange'; 
SELECT County, School, ClosedDate  FROM schools  WHERE StatusType = 'Closed'  GROUP BY County, School, ClosedDate  ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC; 
SELECT sc.School AS SchoolName,         (sc.Street || ', ' || sc.City) AS PostalStreetAddress  FROM satscores s  INNER JOIN schools sc ON s.cds = sc.CDSCode  WHERE s.cds IN (     SELECT cds      FROM satscores      ORDER BY AvgScrMath DESC      LIMIT 1 OFFSET 6 ); 
SELECT s.MailStreet AS MailingStreetAddress, s.School AS SchoolName  FROM schools s  INNER JOIN satscores sc ON s.CDSCode = sc.cds  ORDER BY sc.AvgScrRead ASC  LIMIT 1; 
<think> Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to answer this SQL query question. The user wants the total number of schools where the total SAT score is greater than or equal to 1500 and whose mailing city is Lakeport.  First, I need to understand the database schema provided. There are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. Since the question involves SAT scores, I should look at the satscores table. This table has columns like cds (which is the primary key), rtype, sname, dname, cname, enroll12, NumTstTakr, AvgScrRead, AvgScrMath, AvgScrWrite, and NumGE1500.  The user mentioned that the total SAT score is computed by adding AvgScrRead, AvgScrMath, and AvgScrWrite. So I'll need to sum these three columns in the satscores table.  Next, I have to consider the mailing city being Lakeport. The mailing city information is located in the schools table under the MailCity column. Since the cds in satscores corresponds to CDSCode in schools (as per the foreign key constraints), I'll need to join these tables on cds = CDSCode.  Now, putting it all together, I should write an SQL query that joins satscores and schools, filters by MailCity = 'Lakeport', calculates the total SAT score, checks if it's >=1500, and then counts those schools.  I need to make sure that the join is correct and that only the relevant records are considered. Also, since the user wants the count, I'll use COUNT(*) after applying all filters.  So, the steps in the query would be:  1. SELECT COUNT(*) as the result. 2. FROM satscores table. 3. JOIN with schools on cds = CDSCode. 4. WHERE MailCity = 'Lakeport'. 5. AND (AvgScrRead + AvgScrMath + AvgScrWrite) >= 1500.  I should also ensure that all column names are correctly referenced and that any potential null values in the SAT scores don't affect the calculation, but since the question doesn't specify handling nulls, I'll proceed under the assumption that the data is clean.  Finally, putting it into SQL syntax without comments as per the user's request. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM satscores JOIN schools ON satscores.cds = schools.CDSCode WHERE schools.MailCity = 'Lakeport' AND (satscores.AvgScrRead + satscores.AvgScrMath + satscores.AvgScrWrite) >= 1500;
SELECT SUM(s.NumTstTakr) AS TotalTestTakers  FROM satscores s  JOIN schools sch ON s.cds = sch.CDSCode  WHERE sch.MailCity = 'Fresno'; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.  The user wants all schools and their related mailing zip codes that are under Avetik Atoian's administration. So, I'm looking for schools where one of the administrators is Avetik Atoian, specifically focusing on the mailing zip code associated with those schools.  Looking at the database schema provided, there are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The relevant table here seems to be the 'schools' table because it contains information about each school's administration and mailing details.  In the 'schools' table, I see fields like CDSCode (which is the primary key), various administrative fields such as AdmFName1, AdmLName1, etc., and mailing zip codes under MailZip. So, to find schools administered by Avetik Atoian, I need to check if either of the administrators' first and last names match.  The query should select the school name (School) and the mailing zip code (MailZip). The WHERE clause needs to look for cases where either AdmFName1 and AdmLName1 match 'Avetik Atoian', or AdmFName2 and AdmLName2 do, or AdmFName3 and AdmLName3. So, I'll have to use OR conditions for each possible administrator slot.  I should make sure that the query only selects distinct entries in case a school has multiple administrators with the same name, but it's likely each school will be listed once even if multiple admins match. However, using DISTINCT ensures no duplicates.  Putting it together, the SELECT statement grabs School and MailZip from schools where any of the administrator fields match Avetik Atoian. The WHERE clause is structured to check each possible admin pair with OR conditions.  I also need to ensure that the SQL syntax is correct. Each condition in the WHERE clause should correctly reference the columns and use string literals for comparison. Since the names are case-sensitive, I'll assume 'Avetik' and 'Atoian' are exact matches as provided.  Finally, I'll structure the query without any comments, as per the user's request. </think>  SELECT DISTINCT `School`, `MailZip` FROM `schools` WHERE (`AdmFName1` = 'Avetik' AND `AdmLName1` = 'Atoian') OR (`AdmFName2` = 'Avetik' AND `AdmLName2` = 'Atoian') OR (`AdmFName3` = 'Avetik' AND `AdmLName3` = 'Atoian');
SELECT      (COUNT(CASE WHEN `County` = 'Colusa' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(CASE WHEN `County` = 'Humboldt' THEN 1 END)) AS ratio FROM      schools WHERE      `MailState` = 'CA'; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE MailState = 'CA' AND City = 'San Joaquin' AND StatusType = 'Active'; 
WITH RankedScores AS (     SELECT          s.cds,         ss.AvgScrWrite,         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY ss.AvgScrWrite DESC) AS rn     FROM          schools s     JOIN          satscores ss ON s.CDSCode = ss.cds ) SELECT      s.Phone,      s.Ext FROM      RankedScores rs JOIN      schools s ON rs.cds = s.CDSCode WHERE      rs.rn = 333; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question asks for the phone number and extension of a school with the zip code 95203-3704 and also wants the school's name.  First, I'll look at the database schema provided. There are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. Since the user is asking about the school's phone number and extension, I should check which table contains this information.  Looking at the 'schools' table, it has columns like Phone and Ext, which seem relevant. The primary key here is CDSCode, so any query referencing other tables would probably need to join on this field. But since the question only asks about the school's details, I don't think we need to involve the other tables unless there are missing pieces.  Next, the user provided a zip code: 95203-3704. In the 'schools' table, there's a Zip column that could hold this value. So I can use a WHERE clause to filter by this Zip.  So the structure of my query will be selecting Phone and Ext from the schools table where Zip equals 95203-3704. But wait, the user also wants the school's name. The 'School' column in the schools table should provide that, so I'll include it as well.  Putting this together, the SELECT statement will include School, Phone, and Ext. The FROM clause is just the schools table. The WHERE condition is on Zip being equal to 95203-3704.  I need to make sure about the data types. Since Zip is a TEXT field in the 'schools' table, the value should be treated as a string in SQL. So I'll put it in quotes as '95203-3704'.  Now, considering if there are multiple schools with that zip code, but since the user didn't specify any further details, we can assume they just want all matching records.  So the final query will be:  SELECT School, Phone, Ext FROM schools WHERE Zip = '95203-3704';  I think this should retrieve the necessary information without joining other tables since all required columns are in the 'schools' table. </think>  SELECT `School`, `Phone`, `Ext` FROM `schools` WHERE `Zip` = '95203-3704';
SELECT Website FROM schools WHERE (AdmFName1 = 'Mike' AND AdmLName1 = 'Larson') OR (AdmFName2 = 'Mike' AND AdmLName2 = 'Larson') OR (AdmFName3 = 'Mike' AND AdmLName3 = 'Larson') OR (AdmFName1 = 'Dante' AND AdmLName1 = 'Alvarez') OR (AdmFName2 = 'Dante' AND AdmLName2 = 'Alvarez') OR (AdmFName3 = 'Dante' AND AdmLName3 = 'Alvarez'); 
<think> Alright, let's tackle this SQL problem step by step. The user is asking for the websites of all the partially virtual chartered schools located in San Joaquin.   First, I need to understand the database schema provided. There are three tables: `frpm`, `satscores`, and `schools`. The relevant table here seems to be `schools` since it contains information about each school, including whether they're a charter school and their virtual status.  Looking at the `schools` table, I see columns like `CDSCode`, `County`, `Charter`, and `Virtual`. The user mentioned that Charter schools are indicated by `Charter = 1` and partially virtual is represented by `Virtual = 'P'`. So, I'll need to filter rows where both these conditions are met.  Next, the location is San Joaquin County. Therefore, I should include a condition where `County = 'San Joaquin'`.  The goal is to retrieve the websites of these schools. The `Website` column in the `schools` table holds this information, so that's what I'll select.  Putting it all together, my SQL query will select the `Website` from the `schools` table where `County` is 'San Joaquin', `Charter` is 1, and `Virtual` is 'P'.  I should also consider if there are any potential issues. For example, ensuring that the column names match exactly as in the schema (case-sensitive) and that the values for `Charter` and `Virtual` are correctly specified.  Finally, I'll structure the SQL query accordingly, making sure to use proper syntax and quotation marks where necessary. </think>  SELECT Website FROM schools WHERE County = 'San Joaquin' AND Charter = 1 AND Virtual = 'P';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE Charter = 1 AND DOC = '52' AND City = 'Hickman'; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write the SQL query based on the user's question. Let me break it down step by step.  First, the question asks for the total number of non-chartered schools in Los Angeles County where the percentage of eligible free meals for K-12 is less than 0.18%.   So, I should start by identifying which tables to use. The question mentions schools and their eligibility for free meals, so I'll look at the 'frpm' table because it contains data about meal eligibility. It also refers to the county name, so maybe I need information from the 'schools' table as well.  Wait, but looking at the schema, the 'frpm' table already has a 'County Name' field. So perhaps I can get everything from the 'frpm' table without joining other tables unless necessary.  Next, non-chartered schools are those where Charter = 0. In the 'frpm' table, there's a field called 'Charter School (Y/N)' which might be an integer. Since Y/N is often represented as Yes/No or 1/0 in databases, I think this field should be checked for 0 to indicate non-chartered schools.  The county of interest is Los Angeles, so I need to filter where `County Name` = 'Los Angeles'.  Now, the percentage of eligible free meals is calculated as (Free Meal Count (K-12) / Enrollment (K-12)) * 100. The question wants this percentage to be less than 0.18%. So, I'll write a condition where ((`Free Meal Count (K-12)` / `Enrollment (K-12)`) * 100) < 0.18.  I should also make sure that neither 'Free Meal Count' nor 'Enrollment' is zero to avoid division by zero errors, but the question might imply that these values are valid since they're asking for eligible percentages.  Putting it all together, I'll select from the 'frpm' table where County Name is Los Angeles, Charter School (Y/N) is 0, and the calculated percentage is less than 0.18%. Then, count the number of such schools using COUNT(*).  Wait a second, looking at the schema again, the 'Charter School (Y/N)' field in 'frpm' is an INTEGER. So I should ensure that it's 0 for non-chartered. Also, the condition on the percentage needs to handle cases where Enrollment might be zero to avoid division by zero. But since the question specifies K-12, maybe we can assume valid enrollments.  So, the final SQL query will join conditions on County Name, Charter status, and the calculated percentage, then count the rows that meet all these criteria. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM frpm  WHERE `County Name` = 'Los Angeles'  AND `Charter School (Y/N)` = 0  AND ((`Free Meal Count (K-12)` / `Enrollment (K-12)`) * 100) < 0.18;
SELECT      s.School AS SchoolName,     s.City,     COALESCE(s.AdmFName1 || ' ', '') || COALESCE(s.AdmLName1, '') AS Administrator1,     COALESCE(s.AdmFName2 || ' ', '') || COALESCE(s.AdmLName2, '') AS Administrator2,     COALESCE(s.AdmFName3 || ' ', '') || COALESCE(s.AdmLName3, '') AS Administrator3 FROM      schools s JOIN      frpm f ON s.CDSCode = f.CDSCode WHERE      s.Charter = 1     AND f.CharterSchoolNumber = '00D2'; 
SELECT COUNT(CDSCode) FROM schools WHERE MailCity = 'Hickman' AND CharterNum = '00D4'; 
SELECT      (COUNT(CASE WHEN frpm."Charter Funding Type" = 'Local' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(frpm."Charter Funding Type") * 100) AS ratio_percentage FROM      frpm JOIN      schools ON frpm."CDSCode" = schools."CDSCode" WHERE      schools.County = 'Santa Clara'; 
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM schools  WHERE County = 'Stanislaus' AND FundingType = 'Directly Funded' AND OpenDate BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2005-12-31'; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's question using SQL. The question is asking for the total amount of Community College District closures in 1989 within San Francisco.  First, I'll look at the database schema provided. There are three tables: `frpm`, `satscores`, and `schools`. It seems that the `schools` table contains information about school closures because it has columns like `OpenDate` and `ClosedDate`.  The user is asking specifically about Community College District closures, so I should check if there's a way to identify community colleges in the schema. The `schools` table might have a field indicating the type of institution. Looking at the columns, I see `StatusType`, which could be useful here.  Next, focusing on San Francisco: the city name is in the `City` column of the `schools` table. So I'll need to filter where `City = 'San Francisco'`.  For the year 1989, I need to extract the year from `ClosedDate`. Assuming `ClosedDate` is a date type, using `YEAR(ClosedDate)` would give me the year. Then, I can check if this year equals 1989.  The total amount of closures might refer to the count of schools that closed in that year and city. So I'll use `COUNT(*)` as the aggregate function to get the number of closures.  Putting it all together, my SQL query should select from the `schools` table where the city is San Francisco, the status type indicates a closure (I'm not exactly sure what value this would have, but perhaps 'Closed' or similar), and the year of closure is 1989.  Wait, does the `StatusType` field specifically indicate closures? The schema description doesn't specify that. Maybe I should consider if there's another column that indicates whether a school is closed or not. Looking again at the `schools` table, I see `ClosedDate`, which would be non-null for closed schools. So perhaps instead of checking `StatusType`, I can check if `ClosedDate` is not null and extract the year from it.  So, the query should filter on `City = 'San Francisco'`, `ClosedDate IS NOT NULL`, and `YEAR(ClosedDate) = 1989`. Then count those records.  I think that's a solid approach. So the SQL will be:  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE City = 'San Francisco' AND ClosedDate IS NOT NULL AND YEAR(ClosedDate) = 1989;  This should give me the total number of closures in San Francisco for 1989. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE City = 'San Francisco' AND ClosedDate IS NOT NULL AND YEAR(ClosedDate) = 1989;
SELECT County, COUNT(*) AS ClosureCount FROM schools WHERE YEAR(ClosedDate) BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989     AND SOC = '11' GROUP BY County ORDER BY ClosureCount DESC LIMIT 1; 
<think> Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the SQL query for this user's request.  First, the user wants the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) district ID for all schools classified as State Special Schools. From the extra knowledge provided, I know that State Special Schools are identified by a School Ownership Code (SOC) of 31.  Looking at the database schema, there are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The relevant information here is in the schools table because it contains the CDSCode (which acts as a primary key) and other details about each school, including SOC.  The user's request specifically asks for the NCES district ID, which maps to the 'NCESDist' column in the schools table. So, I need to select that column.  Next, the condition is that the School Ownership Code (SOC) must be 31. The schools table has a 'DOCType' column, but since SOC is the key here, and it's specified as 31, I'll filter using 'WHERE SOC = 31'.  I also need to consider if there are any other conditions or joins necessary. However, since all the required information is in the schools table, no joins with frpm or satscores are needed.  Finally, I construct the SQL query by selecting 'NCESDist' and applying the filter for SOC = 31. </think>  SELECT `NCESDist` FROM `schools` WHERE `SOC` = 31;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE County = 'Alpine' AND DOCType = 'Community Day School' AND StatusType IN ('Active', 'Closed'); 
SELECT frpm.District_Code  FROM frpm  JOIN schools ON frpm.CDSCode = schools.CDSCode  WHERE schools.City = 'Fresno'  AND schools.Magnet = 0; 
SELECT `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`  FROM frpm  JOIN schools ON frpm.CDSCode = schools.CDSCode  WHERE frpm.`Academic Year` = '2014-2015'  AND schools.EdOpsCode = 'SSS'  AND schools.City = 'Fremont'; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for the free or reduced price meal count for ages 5 to 17 in a specific school located at PO Box 1040 as their mailing address.  First, I'll look at the database schema provided. There are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. Since the question is about meal counts, which are related to FRPM (Free or Reduced Price Meals), I should focus on the frpm table. But since we're looking for a specific school, I might need to join this with the schools table.  The user mentioned the mailing street address as PO Box 1040. In the schools table, there's a column called MailStreet which likely holds the mailing address. So I'll use that condition.  I also notice that there are two relevant columns in the frpm table: FRPM Count (Ages 5-17) and Percent (%) Eligible FRPM (Ages 5-17). The user is asking for the count, so I'll select FRPM Count (Ages 5-17).  Now, how do I connect these tables? Both frpm and schools have a CDSCode column. In frpm, it's the primary key, and in schools, it's also the primary key. So I can join them on CDSCode.  Putting this together, I'll write a SELECT statement that joins the frpm and schools tables on CDSCode. Then, I'll filter where MailStreet is 'PO Box 1040'. Since the user wants just the count, I'll select that specific column from the frpm table.  I should also consider if there are any other conditions or potential issues. For example, do I need to handle cases where CDSCode might be NULL? But since it's a primary key in both tables, it shouldn't be NULL. Also, ensuring that the join is correct and that the condition on MailStreet accurately targets the specific school.  So, the final query should select FRPM Count (Ages 5-17) from frpm where the joined schools table has MailStreet as 'PO Box 1040'. </think>  SELECT `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` FROM `frpm` AS f JOIN `schools` AS s ON f.`CDSCode` = s.`CDSCode` WHERE s.`MailStreet` = 'PO Box 1040';
SELECT `frpm`.`Low Grade` FROM `frpm` INNER JOIN `schools` ON `frpm`.`CDSCode` = `schools`.`CDSCode` WHERE `schools`.`EdOpsCode` = 'SPECON' AND `schools`.`NCESDist` = '0613360'; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's question using SQL. The question is asking for the educational level name and school names where the Breakfast Provision is 2 in county code 37.  First, I'll look at the database schema provided. There are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The relevant table seems to be 'frpm' because it contains information about meal provisions, including 'NSLP Provision Status', which might relate to breakfast provision.  The user mentioned "Breakfast Provision 2", so I'm guessing that corresponds to a specific value in the NSLP Provision Status field. In the frpm table, this column is of type TEXT, so it's likely a string value like '2' or maybe a description. But since the question specifies 'Provision 2', I'll use '2' as the filter.  Next, the county code is given as 37. The 'County Code' in the frpm table is an INTEGER, so that should be straightforward to match with 37.  The user wants the educational level name and school name. Looking at the frpm table, I don't see an 'Educational Level Name' column. Wait, perhaps they meant the 'Educational Option Type', which is a TEXT field in frpm. That could indicate the type of education or program offered. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to something else, but given the options, that seems like the closest match.  So, I'll need to select 'Educational Option Type' and 'School Name' from the frpm table where NSLP Provision Status is '2' and County Code is 37.  I should also ensure that School Name isn't null because we want actual names. So adding a condition where School Name is not null would be good.  Putting it all together, the SQL query will select those two columns from frpm where NSLP Provision Status is '2', County Code is 37, and School Name exists. </think>  SELECT `Educational Option Type`, `School Name` FROM `frpm` WHERE `NSLP Provision Status` = 'Breakfast Provision 2' AND `County Code` = 37 AND `School Name` IS NOT NULL;
SELECT `City`  FROM `frpm`  INNER JOIN `schools` ON `frpm`.`CDSCode` = `schools`.`CDSCode`  WHERE `EILCode` = 'HS'      AND `NSLP Provision Status` = '2'      AND `Low Grade` = '9'      AND `High Grade` = '12'      AND `County Name` = 'Merced'; 
<think> Alright, so I need to figure out the SQL query based on the user's question. Let's break it down step by step.  First, the user is asking for schools in Los Angeles County that serve grades Kindergarten through 9th grade. They also want to know the percentage of eligible FRPM (Free and Reduced Price Meals) for ages 5-17.  Looking at the database schema, there are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The relevant information seems to be in the frpm and schools tables since they contain details about enrollment, meal eligibility, and school locations.  The user mentioned that the percentage is calculated by dividing FRPM Count (Ages 5-17) by Enrollment (Ages 5-17) and multiplying by 100. In SQL, I can compute this using a CASE statement to handle any division by zero errors, but since the question doesn't specify handling that, maybe it's optional.  Next, I need to join the tables. The frpm table has a CDSCode which is the primary key and references schools.CDSCode. So, an INNER JOIN between frpm and schools on CDSCode makes sense.  Now, filtering by Los Angeles County: schools.County should be 'Los Angeles'.  For the grade span Kindergarten to 9th grade, I think that means the Low Grade is 'K' and High Grade is '9'. Both conditions need to be met, so I'll include WHERE frpm.LowGrade = 'K' AND frpm.HighGrade = '9'.  Putting it all together, I'll SELECT the School Name from schools and calculate the percentage from frpm. The JOIN ensures we get the right data, and the WHERE clauses filter by county, low grade, and high grade.  I should make sure that the column names match exactly as they are in the schema. Also, since CDSCode is a TEXT type, I don't need to worry about data type conversions there.  So, the final query will join frpm and schools on CDSCode, filter by Los Angeles County, grades K-9, and calculate the FRPM percentage for ages 5-17. </think>  SELECT s.School Name, (f.`FRPM Count  (Ages 5-17)` / f.`Enrollment  (Ages 5-17)`) * 100 AS `Percent (%) Eligible FRPM (Ages 5-17)` FROM schools s INNER JOIN frpm f ON s.CDSCode = f.CDSCode WHERE s.County = 'Los Angeles' AND f.Low Grade = 'K' AND f.High Grade = '9';
SELECT      CONCAT(`Low Grade`, '-', `High Grade`) AS grade_span,     COUNT(*) AS frequency FROM      schools WHERE      City = 'Adelanto' GROUP BY      grade_span ORDER BY      frequency DESC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS CountOfNonPhysicalSchools FROM schools WHERE County IN ('San Diego', 'Santa Barbara')  AND Virtual = 'F'; 
SELECT      s.SchoolName,      f.`School Type` AS SchoolType,     s.Latitude FROM      schools s JOIN      frpm f ON s.CDSCode = f.CDSCode ORDER BY      s.Latitude DESC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT `City`, `School`, `Low Grade` FROM `schools` WHERE `State` = 'CA' ORDER BY `Latitude` ASC LIMIT 1; 
  SELECT CDSCode FROM schools    WHERE ABS(Longitude) = (SELECT MAX(ABS(Longitude)) FROM schools)   
SELECT      frpm.City AS City,     COUNT(DISTINCT frpm.CDSCode) AS NumberOfSchools FROM      frpm JOIN      schools ON frpm.CDSCode = schools.CDSCode WHERE      schools.Magnet = 1     AND frpm.LowGrade = 'Kindergarten'     AND frpm.HighGrade = '8'     AND frpm.`NSLP Provision Status` = 'Multiple Provision Types' GROUP BY      frpm.City ORDER BY      City; 
WITH AdminData AS (     SELECT AdmFName1 AS FirstName, District FROM Employees     UNION ALL     SELECT AdmFName2 AS FirstName, District FROM Employees     UNION ALL     SELECT AdmFName3 AS FirstName, District FROM Employees ), NamedCounts AS (     SELECTFirstName,            COUNT(*) as TotalCount,            DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as Rank     FROM AdminData     GROUP BYFirstName ) SELECT DISTINCT N.FirstName, A.District FROM NamedCounts N JOIN AdminData A ON N.FirstName = A.FirstName WHERE N.Rank <= 2; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.  The question is: "What is the Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12) in the school administered by an administrator whose first name is Alusine? List the district code of the school."  First, I need to break this down into parts. The main goal is to find the percentage eligible for free meals in K-12 for a specific school. Additionally, I need to list the district code of that school.  Looking at the database schema provided, there are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The schools table seems relevant because it contains information about administrators, which is crucial since the question specifies an administrator's first name.  In the schools table, there are columns like AdmFName1, AdmLName1, etc., which store the names of administrators. So, I'll need to filter the rows where AdmFName1 equals 'Alusine'.  Next, the percentage calculation is given as (Free Meal Count / Enrollment) * 100%. This data is in the frpm table under the columns 'Free Meal Count (K-12)' and 'Enrollment (K-12)'. So, I'll need to join the schools table with the frpm table using their common key, which is CDSCode.  Now, considering how to structure the SQL query:  1. **SELECT Clause**: I need to calculate the percentage. That can be done using a CASE statement to handle division by zero. The formula would be (Free Meal Count / Enrollment) * 100. Also, I need to include the district code from the schools table.  2. **FROM Clause**: Start with the schools table since that's where the administrator information is.  3. **JOIN Clause**: Perform an INNER JOIN with the frpm table on CDSCode because each school in the schools table has a corresponding entry in frpm.  4. **WHERE Clause**: Filter where AdmFName1 is 'Alusine'.  Putting this together, I need to make sure that all necessary columns are selected and joined correctly. Also, handle any potential division by zero errors by using a CASE statement in the calculation.  I should also consider if there are multiple administrators per school (like AdmFName2, AdmFName3), but since the question specifies "administered by an administrator whose first name is Alusine," it implies at least one such admin. So, checking AdmFName1 seems sufficient unless the database allows for multiple admins with the same first name, but I think handling at least one occurrence is enough here.  Finally, ensure that the SQL syntax is correct, using proper aliases and table names as per the schema. </think>  SELECT      (frpm.`Free Meal Count  (K-12)` / frpm.`Enrollment  (K-12)`) * 100 AS `Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)`,     schools.`District Code` FROM     schools INNER JOIN frpm ON schools.CDSCode = frpm.CDSCode WHERE     schools.AdmFName1 = 'Alusine';
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for the administrator's last name that oversees a school with a specific charter number, which is 40. Additionally, they want to know the district, county, and name of that school.  First, I'll look at the database schema provided to understand where each piece of information is stored. There are three tables: `frpm`, `satscores`, and `schools`.   The `schools` table seems crucial because it contains details about each school, including whether they're a charter school, their CDSCode (which might be used as an identifier), and possibly the administrator's information.  Looking at the `schools` table, I see columns like `CharterNum`, which is likely where the charter number is stored. The user wants the school with Charter number 40, so that's a condition we'll need in our WHERE clause: `WHERE CharterNum = 40`.  Next, we need to find the administrator's last name. The `schools` table has columns like `AdmLName1`, `AdmLName2`, and `AdmLName3`. These probably represent the last names of up to three administrators. Since the question specifies "the administrator," I'm assuming there might be only one, but it's safer to include all possible fields in case multiple are present.  Then, we need the district name. The `District` column in the `schools` table should provide that information. Similarly, the `County` column will give us the county where the school is located. The `School` column gives the name of the school.  Putting this all together, the SQL query needs to select these specific columns: `AdmLName1`, `AdmLName2`, `AdmLName3` for the last names, `District` for the district, `County` for the county, and `School` for the school name. The FROM clause will specify the `schools` table since all necessary data is there.  The WHERE clause filters the results to only include the row where `CharterNum = 40`. I don't think we need any JOINs because all required fields are in the `schools` table, so no other tables are involved here.  I should make sure that the column names match exactly as they are in the schema. For example, it's `AdmLName1`, not `AdminLastName` or something else. Also, I need to ensure that the CDSCode is correctly used if needed elsewhere, but in this case, since we're filtering by CharterNum, which is a direct field, no joins are necessary.  Finally, I'll write the SQL query without any comments as per the user's instruction. </think>  SELECT `AdmLName1`, `AdmLName2`, `AdmLName3`, `District`, `County`, `School` FROM `schools` WHERE `CharterNum` = 40;
SELECT `CDSCode`, `AdmEmail1`, `AdmEmail2`, `AdmEmail3`  FROM `schools`  WHERE `County` = 'San Bernardino'  AND `District` = 'City of San Bernardino Unified'  AND `OpenDate` BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2010-12-31' AND (`DOC` = 54 OR `SOC` = 62);

<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to calculate the percentage of 'Gold' cards that were issued before 1998. Let me start by understanding what each part of the question means.  First, the user is asking for a percentage. That means I'll need to count two things: the number of Gold cards issued prior to 1998 and the total number of all cards. Then, I can divide those counts and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.  Looking at the database schema provided, the relevant table is 'cards'. It has columns like card_id, type, and issue_date. So, I'll be querying this table.  For the numerator, I need to count how many cards have type 'Gold' and their issue_date is before 1998. The date format in the database isn't specified, but since it's a date field, I can assume it's in a standard format where comparing with '1998-01-01' will work correctly. So, my condition would be WHERE type = 'Gold' AND issue_date < '1998-01-01'.  For the denominator, I need the total number of all cards. That's straightforward: a COUNT(*) on the same table.  Putting it together, I can use two subqueries or calculate them in separate parts and then combine. But since SQL allows using aggregate functions directly in the SELECT clause, I can write it as:  COUNT(CASE WHEN type = 'Gold' AND issue_date < '1998-01-01' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*) * 100.  This way, both counts are done in a single query. The CASE statement ensures that only the Gold cards issued before 1998 are counted in the numerator, while the denominator is all cards.  I should also check if there's any possibility of division by zero, but since the question implies there are Gold cards, I can safely assume the total isn't zero. However, in a more robust scenario, I might include a check for that.  So, the final SQL query selects the calculated percentage from the 'cards' table. </think>  SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN type = 'Gold' AND issued < '1998-01-01' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS gold_card_percentage FROM cards;

<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "On average, how many carcinogenic molecules are single bonded?"   First, let's break down what each part means.  Carcinogenic molecules refer to those where the label is '+'. So, I'll be looking at molecules in the 'molecule' table with a label of '+'.  Single-bonded means that the bond_type is '-'. The bonds are stored in the 'bond' table. But not all bonds contribute equally because each bond connects two atoms, right? So if I just count all single bonds, I might be double-counting since each bond appears twice in the 'connected' table.  The average is calculated by dividing the sum of single bonds (each counted once) by the number of atoms in those molecules. Wait, but how do I ensure that each bond is only counted once? Maybe using a WHERE clause on the atom_id to count each bond once. For example, considering only cases where atom_id < atom_id2 might help avoid duplication.  Putting it all together:  1. Identify all single bonds (bond_type '-') in molecules with label '+'. 2. Ensure each bond is counted once by filtering with atom_id < atom_id2 in the 'connected' table. 3. Count these unique single bonds and divide by the total number of atoms in those molecules to get the average.  So, I'll join the necessary tables: molecule, atom, connected, and bond. Using a WHERE clause on label '+' and bond_type '-', along with atom_id < atom_id2, should give me the correct count of single bonds. Then, divide that by the total number of atoms in those molecules to find the average. </think>  SELECT      (COUNT(bond.bond_id) / COUNT(atom.atom_id)) AS average_single_bonds FROM      molecule JOIN      atom ON molecule.molecule_id = atom.molecule_id JOIN      connected ON atom.atom_id = connected.atom_id JOIN      bond ON connected.bond_id = bond.bond_id WHERE      molecule.label = '+' AND bond.bond_type = '-' GROUP BY      molecule.molecule_id;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM atom  INNER JOIN molecule ON atom.molecule_id = molecule.molecule_id  WHERE element = 'na' AND label = '-'; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for triple-bonded molecules that are carcinogenic.   First, let me break down the terms. Triple-bonded refers to a bond type of '#', and carcinogenic means the label should be '+'. So I'm looking for molecules where there exists at least one bond with type '#' and the molecule's label is '+'.  Looking at the database schema, there are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The key here seems to be the 'bond' table because it contains the bond_type which we need to check for '#'. Also, the 'molecule' table has the label field that indicates if a molecule is carcinogenic.  I'll start by selecting from the molecule table since that's where the label is stored. I need to join this with the bond table because the bond type tells us about the triple bonds. The foreign key in the bond table references the molecule_id, so we can connect them using molecule_id.  The SQL structure should be something like: SELECT * FROM molecule JOIN bond ON molecule.molecule_id = bond.molecule_id WHERE bond.bond_type = '#' AND molecule.label = '+';  Wait, but is that enough? Let me think. Each bond belongs to a molecule, so joining them directly makes sense. The where clause checks for the correct bond type and label.  Alternatively, I could use an EXISTS clause or a subquery, but since we're just looking for existence of any triple bond in the molecule, a simple join should suffice as long as there's at least one such bond.  Let me check if this covers all cases. If a molecule has multiple bonds, some triple and others not, it will still be included because the condition is met by at least one bond. The label must also be '+', which we're checking directly in the where clause.  I think that's correct. So the SQL query should select from molecule, join with bond on molecule_id, then apply the conditions for bond_type and label. </think>  SELECT * FROM `molecule` WHERE `label` = '+' AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM `bond` WHERE `molecule_
SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN element = 'c' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100 / COUNT(atom_id)) AS percentage FROM atom  WHERE molecule_id IN (     SELECT molecule_id      FROM bond      WHERE bond_type = '=' ); 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to answer the user's question: "How many triple type bonds are there?" They mentioned that a triple type bond refers to a bond where the bond_type is '#'.   First, I'll look at the database schema provided to understand the tables and their structures. The relevant table here is the 'bond' table because it contains information about each bond, including the bond_id, molecule_id, and bond_type.  The user wants the count of bonds with a specific type, which is '#'. So my task is to write an SQL query that counts how many entries in the 'bond' table have bond_type equal to '#'.  I'll start by selecting the count from the 'bond' table. The COUNT(*) function will give me the total number of rows that meet the condition.   Next, I need to specify the condition: bond_type should be '#'. This means I'll use a WHERE clause to filter the results.  Putting it all together, the SQL query should be straightforward. It selects the count from the 'bond' table where the bond_type is exactly '#'.  I don't think there are any other tables involved in this particular question since the necessary information is all within the 'bond' table. So no joins or additional columns are needed.  Finally, I'll write the SQL query ensuring it's correct and efficient. It should be simple and only return the count without any extra data. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '#';
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking, "In how many atoms is there no bromine?" So, essentially, they want the count of atoms where the element is not bromine.  First, I should look at the database schema provided. There are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The relevant table here is 'atom' because it contains information about each atom, including its element.  The 'atom' table has columns: atom_id, molecule_id, and element. The element column is a text field that can be NULL by default. So, I need to count all the rows where the element is not equal to 'br'.  Wait, but in SQL, if a column allows NULLs, we have to consider them as well. Does the user mean atoms where the element isn't bromine or where it's completely missing (NULL)? The extra knowledge provided says "element != 'br'", so I think it includes both cases: elements that are not 'br' and elements that are NULL.  So, my query should count all atoms where the element is either not equal to 'br' or is NULL. But wait, in SQL, using WHERE element != 'br' will automatically exclude NULLs because NULL isn't equal to any value, including 'br'. So if I only use element != 'br', it will miss the rows where element is NULL.  To include both cases (element not 'br' and element is NULL), I need to use two conditions: WHERE element != 'br' OR element IS NULL. Alternatively, since the user's extra knowledge specifies "element != 'br'", which might imply that we should exclude only bromine, including all others regardless of whether their element is NULL or not.  Wait, but in the data provided, looking at the INSERT statements for the atom table, none of them have a NULL element. All elements are specified as 'cl', 'c', etc. So maybe the user's concern about NULLs isn't necessary here because all elements are filled. But it's still good practice to write the query correctly in case there are NULLs.  However, considering the data, the atom table has records like ('TR000_1', 'TR000', 'cl'), so element is always present. Therefore, for this specific dataset, the count would include all atoms except those with element 'br'. So, if no atom has element 'br', then the result would be the total number of atoms.  Looking at the data provided, none have 'br' as an element. They have 'cl', 'c', and 'h'. Therefore, the query should return 5, which is all the atoms in the table since none are bromine.  But regardless of the data, the SQL should correctly reflect the question. So the correct approach is to count all atoms where the element is not equal to 'br'.  So, putting it together: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM atom WHERE element != 'br';  Alternatively, if I wanted to include NULLs, I would write WHERE (element != 'br' OR element IS NULL). But based on the user's note and the data provided, this isn't necessary here.  Therefore, the SQL query should be as simple as counting all atoms where the element is not bromine. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM atom WHERE element != 'br';
SELECT COUNT(molecule_id) FROM molecule WHERE label = '+' AND molecule_id BETWEEN 'TR000' AND 'TR099'; 
<think> Alright, let's tackle this SQL problem step by step. The goal is to identify molecules that contain at least one carbon atom.   First, I'll start by understanding the database schema provided. There are four tables: `atom`, `bond`, `connected`, and `molecule`. Each table has specific columns and relationships.  The key here is the `atom` table because it contains information about each atom, including its element. Carbon atoms will have the element 'c' in this table.   So, I need to find all molecules that have at least one carbon atom. To do this, I can look into the `atom` table where the `element` is 'c'. Each of these atoms has a `molecule_id`, which links back to the `molecule` table.  Next, I'll join the `atom` and `molecule` tables using the `molecule_id`. This allows me to see which molecules have carbon atoms. By grouping the results by `molecule_aid` (since each molecule can have multiple carbon atoms), I can ensure that each molecule is listed only once.  Finally, I'll select the distinct `molecule_id` from this joined result to get a list of all unique molecules containing at least one carbon atom.  I should also consider using explicit table aliases or fully qualified column names for clarity, but in this case, since the `molecule_id` is unique across both tables, it's straightforward enough without them. </think>  SELECT DISTINCT molecule.molecule_aid FROM molecule JOIN atom ON molecule.molecule_aid = atom.molecule_aid WHERE element = 'c';
SELECT DISTINCT a.element  FROM atom a JOIN connected c ON a.atom_id = c.atom_1 OR a.atom_id = c.atom_2 WHERE c.bond_id = 'TR004_8_9'; 
SELECT DISTINCT a.element  FROM atom a  JOIN connected c1 ON a.atom_id = c1.atom_id  JOIN bond b ON c1.bond_id = b.bond_id  WHERE b.bond_type = '='; 
SELECT molecule.label  FROM atom  JOIN molecule ON atom.molecule_id = molecule.molecule_id  WHERE atom.element = 'h'  GROUP BY molecule.label  ORDER BY COUNT(molecule.label) DESC  LIMIT 1; 
SELECT DISTINCT b.bond_type  FROM atom a1  JOIN connected c ON a1.atom_id = c.atom_1  JOIN bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id  WHERE a1.element = 'cl'; 
SELECT      a1.element AS element1,     a2.element AS element2 FROM      connected c JOIN      bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id JOIN      atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id JOIN      atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id WHERE      b.bond_type = '-'; 
 SELECT * FROM connected JOIN atom AS a1 ON connected.atom_id = a1.atom_id JOIN atom AS a2 ON connected.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id WHERE a1.molecule_id IN (SELECT molecule_id FROM molecule WHERE label = '-') AND a2.molecule_id IN (SELECT molecule_id FROM molecule WHERE label = '-'); 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out which element is the least numerous in non-carcinogenic molecules based on the provided database schema and data. Let's break this down step by step.  First, I understand that non-carcinogenic molecules are those where the label is '-'. So, from the molecule table, I'll select all entries where label equals '-'.  Next, each atom belongs to a molecule through the molecule_id in the atom table. So, for each of these non-carcinogenic molecules, I need to count how many times each element appears across their atoms.  I think the way to approach this is by joining the molecule and atom tables on molecule_id. That way, I can filter for only those atoms that belong to molecules with label '-'.  Once I have all the relevant atoms, I'll group them by the element type. For each group of elements (like 'cl', 'c', etc.), I'll count how many times they appear.  The goal is to find the minimum count among these groups because "least numerous" refers to the smallest number of occurrences. So, after grouping and counting, I need to sort these counts and pick the one with the lowest value. If there's a tie for the minimum, I might need to select all elements that have this minimum count.  Putting it all together: 1. Join molecule and atom on molecule_id. 2. Filter where label is '-'. 3. Group by element. 4. Count occurrences of each element in these groups. 5. Find the group(s) with the smallest count. 6. Return the corresponding element(s).  Now, considering SQL syntax, I'll use a SELECT statement with COUNT and GROUP BY. Then, to find the minimum, I can either use a subquery or window functions, but since it's about the least count, using MIN in an aggregate way would work.  Wait, actually, to get just the element(s) that have the least count, I might need to first calculate all counts and then select those with the minimum value. So, perhaps a two-step approach: one query to find the minimum count, another to fetch elements having that count.  Alternatively, within a single query, using a common table expression (CTE) or subqueries could help.  But looking at how I can structure this, maybe it's more efficient to get all counts first and then select from them where the count is equal to the overall minimum. However, since SQL doesn't allow direct referencing of aliases in the same query level without a CTE or subquery, I need to plan accordingly.  Wait, perhaps using a window function like RANK() would help. But for simplicity, maybe it's better to first get the counts and then find the min.  Alternatively, just group by element and count, then order by count ascending and limit 1. But that might not handle ties if multiple elements have the same minimum count.  The user didn't specify what to do in case of a tie, so perhaps returning all such elements is acceptable.  So, putting it together:  - Join molecule m and atom a where m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id. - Filter for m.label = '-'. - Group by a.element. - Count the number of atoms per element. - Order these counts in ascending order. - Select the first one or all if there are ties.  But since SQL doesn't directly support ordering within the same query when using group by and count, perhaps I can wrap it into a subquery to find the minimum count, then select elements that have this count.  Alternatively, use a CTE to get counts, then select from CTE where count is equal to the min of counts in the CTE.  Let me think about the exact SQL syntax. Here's how it might look:  1. Create a subquery or CTE that groups by element and calculates the count. 2. In another query, find the minimum count from this subquery/CTE. 3. Select elements where their count equals this minimum.  This approach ensures that I correctly identify all elements with the least count.  Alternatively, using a single query with a MIN() in the HAVING clause might not be straightforward because HAVING applies after grouping, but it's used to filter groups based on aggregate conditions. So perhaps:  SELECT element, COUNT(*) as cnt FROM atom a JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE m.label = '-' GROUP BY element HAVING cnt = (SELECT MIN(cnt) FROM (     SELECT COUNT(*) as cnt FROM atom a2      JOIN molecule m2 ON a2.molecule_id = m2.molecule_id      WHERE m2.label = '-'      GROUP BY a2.element ) as min_counts) ORDER BY cnt ASC;  Wait, that might work. The subquery calculates the minimum count of elements in non-carcinogenic molecules. Then, the outer query selects those elements whose count equals this minimum.  Yes, that should give me all elements with the least numerous counts in the specified category. </think>  SELECT element FROM atom a JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE m.label = '-' GROUP BY element HAVING COUNT(*) = (     SELECT MIN(cnt)      FROM (         SELECT COUNT(*) as cnt          FROM atom a2          JOIN molecule m2 ON a2.molecule_id = m2.molecule_id          WHERE m2.label = '-'          GROUP BY a2.element     ) as min_counts ) ORDER BY COUNT(*);  The final answer is the element(s) with the least count. For example, if 'c' has the smallest count:  \boxed{C}
<think> Alright, I need to figure out the SQL query for the question: "What type of bond is there between the atoms TR004_8 and TR004_20?"   First, let's break down what each part means. The question is asking about the bond type between two specific atoms. From the provided tables, I know that bonds are stored in the `bond` table with a `bond_type` column. However, to find which bond connects the two atoms, I need to look into the `connected` table.  The `connected` table has entries for each connection between two atoms, including the `bond_id`. So, to find the bond type between TR004_8 and TR004_20, I should first check if there's a record in `connected` where either atom_1 is TR004_8 and atom_2 is TR004_20, or vice versa.  Once I have the corresponding `bond_id`, I can join this with the `bond` table to get the `bond_type`.  Now, considering how to structure the SQL query:  1. **Identify the connection in the `connected` table**: Use a WHERE clause that checks for either (atom_1 = 'TR004_8' AND atom_2 = 'TR004_20') OR (atom_1 = 'TR004_20' AND atom_2 = 'TR004_8').     2. **Join with the `bond` table**: Use an INNER JOIN on `bond_id` to get the bond details.  3. **Select the `bond_type`**: That's what we're interested in.  I should also consider if there could be multiple connections between these atoms, but given the schema and data provided, it seems each connection is unique per `connected` record.  Putting this together, the SQL query will select the bond type from both tables where the conditions are met. </think>  SELECT bond.bond_type FROM connected INNER JOIN bond ON connected.bond_id = bond.bond_id WHERE (connected.atom_1 = 'TR004_8' AND connected.atom_2 = 'TR004_20') OR (connected.atom_1 = 'TR004_20' AND connected.atom_2 = 'TR004_8');
SELECT l.label FROM (     SELECT DISTINCT label     FROM molecule ) l WHERE l.label NOT IN (     SELECT m.label     FROM molecule m     JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id     WHERE a.element != 'sn' ); 
WITH SingleBondAtoms AS (     SELECT DISTINCT          a.molecule_id,         a.atom_id     FROM          connected c     JOIN          bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id     JOIN          atom a ON c.atom_id = a.atom_id     WHERE          b.bond_type = '-' ) SELECT      COUNT(DISTINCT sa.atom_id) AS total_atoms FROM      SingleBondAtoms sa JOIN      atom a ON sa.atom_id = a.atom_id WHERE      a.element IN ('i', 's'); 
SELECT atom_id, atom_id2  FROM connected  JOIN bond ON connected.bond_id = bond.bond_id  WHERE bond.bond_type = '#'; 
   SELECT atom_id FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR181';    
SELECT (     (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) FROM atom a RIGHT JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE m.label = '+' AND a.element != 'f' GROUP BY m.molecule_id HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN a.element = 'f' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0)     /      (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m2.molecule_id) FROM molecule m2 WHERE m2.label = '+') ) * 100 AS percentage; 
SELECT      (SUM(CASE WHEN bond_type = '#' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100 / COUNT(bond_id)) AS percent  FROM      bond  WHERE      molecule_id IN (SELECT molecule_id FROM molecule WHERE label = '+'); 
SELECT DISTINCT element FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR000' ORDER BY element ASC LIMIT 3; 
SELECT a.atom_id AS atom1, b.atom_id AS atom2  FROM connected c  JOIN atom a ON c.atom_id = a.atom_id  JOIN atom b ON c.atom_id2 = b.atom_id  WHERE c.bond_id = 'TR001_2_6' AND a.molecule_id = 'TR001'; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's question using SQL based on the provided database schema and data.  The question is: "What is the difference between the number of molecules that are carcinogenic and those that are not?"   From the extra knowledge given: - label '+' means the molecule is carcinogenic. - label '-' means it's non-carcinogenic. - The difference is calculated by subtracting the count of non-carcinogenic from carcinogenic.  So, I need to count how many molecules have label '+', how many have '-', and then find their difference.  Looking at the schema, the relevant table is 'molecule' with columns molecule_id and label. So, I can directly query this table without needing joins since all necessary data is in one place.  I'll use COUNT() with a WHERE clause to get the counts for each category. Then, subtract the two counts to get the difference.  Putting it together: SELECT (COUNT(label = '+') - COUNT(label = '-')) AS difference FROM molecule;  Wait, but actually, in SQL, you can't directly use expressions like label = '+' inside the COUNT function like that. Instead, I should filter each count separately using WHERE clauses and subtract them in a subquery or derived table.  Alternatively, use SUM withCASE WHEN to calculate counts for each category.  Let me think again. Another approach is: SELECT      (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule WHERE label = '+') -      (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule WHERE label = '-') AS difference;  This makes sense because it directly calculates the counts and subtracts them, giving the desired difference.  I should test this query structure to ensure correctness. It selects two subqueries: one counting '+' labels and another counting '-', then subtracts the latter from the former.  Yes, that should work. </think>  SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule WHERE label = '+') - (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule WHERE label = '-') AS difference;  The SQL query calculates the difference between the number of carcinogenic ('+') and non-carcinogenic '-' molecules by counting each category separately and subtracting their counts.
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to answer the user's question using SQL. The question is asking for the atom IDs of the bond with the ID 'TR000_2_5'.   First, I'll look at the database schema. There are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The relevant ones here are bond and connected. The 'bond' table contains information about each bond, including its ID. The 'connected' table links atoms via bonds by storing atom IDs and the corresponding bond ID.  I remember that the 'connected' table has three columns: atom_id, atom_id2, and bond_id. Each row in this table represents a connection between two atoms using a specific bond. So, for the given bond ID, I need to find all rows in 'connected' where bond_id is 'TR000_2_5'.  The SQL query should select both atom_id and atom_id2 from the connected table where bond_id matches the specified value. This will give me both atoms involved in that particular bond.  Now, constructing the query: I'll use SELECT to get atom_id and atom_id2. The FROM clause will specify the 'connected' table. The WHERE condition filters the results to only include rows where bond_id is exactly 'TR000_2_5'.   I should make sure to enclose string values in single quotes, so 'TR000_2_5' is correctly formatted. Also, since the connected table might have duplicate entries (like both directions of a connection), the query will still capture all necessary atom IDs without needing additional joins or aggregations.  In summary, the SQL statement will fetch both atoms connected by the specified bond, providing the required information. </think>  SELECT atom_id, atom_id2 FROM connected WHERE bond_id = 'TR000_2_5';
SELECT DISTINCT bond_id FROM connected WHERE atom_id2 = 'TR000_2'; 
SELECT DISTINCT molecule_id FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '=' ORDER BY molecule_id ASC LIMIT 5; 
<think> Alright, let me try to figure out how to solve this SQL problem. The user is asking for the percentage of double bonds in the molecule TR008.   First, I need to understand the database schema provided. There are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The relevant tables here are 'bond' since it contains bond information including bond type, and 'molecule' which holds the molecule IDs.  The question specifies that a double bond is where bond_type equals '='. So, I need to count how many bonds in TR008 have this type. Then, I'll divide that by the total number of bonds in TR008 to get the percentage.  Looking at the 'bond' table, each bond has a bond_id, molecule_id, and bond_type. The molecule_id is what connects it to the specific molecule, which in this case is TR008.  So the plan is: 1. Count all bonds where molecule_id is TR008 and bond_type is '='. 2. Count all bonds where molecule_id is TR008. 3. Divide the first count by the second count to get the percentage. 4. Multiply by 100 to convert it into a percentage.  I should use SQL aggregate functions for counting. The COUNT function can be used with conditions in a WHERE clause. Also, using alias names like 'percent' will make the result clear.  Wait, but what if there are no bonds in TR008? That could cause a division by zero error. However, since the user provided TR008 as an example and given that other molecules have entries, it's safe to assume TR008 has some bonds. But perhaps adding a check or handling division by zero would be good practice, though it's not specified here.  So, putting it all together, I'll write a SELECT statement that calculates the percentage using COUNT with conditions. The result should be formatted to five decimal places as a percentage.  I think that covers all the necessary steps. Now, let me construct the SQL query accordingly. </think>  SELECT ROUND((COUNT(CASE WHEN bond_type = '=' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(bond_id)) * 100, 5) AS percent FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR008';
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that calculates the percentage of molecules that are carcinogenic based on the given database schema and data. Let me break it down step by step.  First, from the user's question, I understand they want the percentage of molecules labeled as '+', which indicates they're carcinogenic. The extra knowledge provided also confirms this: label '+' means the molecule is carcinogenic.  Looking at the database schema, there's a table called `molecule` with columns `molecule_id` and `label`. Each entry in this table represents a molecule, and its `label` determines if it's carcinogenic.  To find the percentage, I need two pieces of information: 1. The total number of molecules. 2. The count of molecules labeled as '+'.  The formula for the percentage is (number of carcinogenic molecules / total number of molecules) * 100. The user also specified to present this with three decimal places.  So, in SQL terms, I can use aggregation functions to get these counts.   - `COUNT(molecule_id)` will give the total number of molecules because each molecule has a unique `molecule_id`. - To count how many have label '+', I'll use `SUM(CASE WHEN label = '+' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)`. This sums up 1 for every row where the label is '+', effectively counting those rows.  Putting it all together, I can write a SELECT statement that calculates this percentage. Using a CASE statement within the SUM allows me to conditionally count only the rows with label '+'. Then, dividing that sum by the total count and multiplying by 100 gives the percentage.  I should also ensure that the result is formatted to three decimal places. In SQL, using the appropriate formatting functions would achieve this, but since the user wants just the query without comments, I'll focus on the calculation part.  Finally, I'll write the SQL query selecting from the `molecule` table and applying these calculations. </think>  SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN label = '+' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(molecule_id)) * 100 AS percent FROM molecule;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `atom` WHERE `molecule_id` = 'TR206'; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking about the type of bond that molecule TR000 has when involved in any bonds.   First, looking at the database schema provided, there are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The relevant tables here seem to be the bond table because it contains information about bond types, and the connected table which links atoms through bonds.  The user mentioned that the type of bond refers to bond_type, and TR000 is the molecule_id. So, I need to find all bonds associated with molecule TR000 and retrieve their bond_type.  I see that the bond table has columns: bond_id, molecule_id, and bond_type. Since we're interested in the bond_type for TR000, a simple SELECT statement from the bond table where molecule_id is 'TR000' should suffice.  Wait, but I should check if there are any other constraints or relationships that might affect this query. The connected table links atoms via bonds, but since the user's question doesn't mention anything about specific atoms or connections beyond the bond type, it seems unnecessary to involve the connected table here.  So, the straightforward approach is to select bond_type from the bond table where molecule_id equals 'TR000'. This should return all the bond types for that molecule.  I also need to ensure that the query doesn't include any duplicate entries. However, looking at the data inserted into the bond table, each bond has a unique bond_id and is associated with a specific molecule_id. Since TR000 has multiple bonds, selecting all of them will give all the bond types it's involved in.  Therefore, the SQL query should be:  SELECT bond_type FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR000';  This will fetch all bond types for molecule TR000 as required. </think>  SELECT bond_type FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR000';
<think> Alright, let's break down how I approached this SQL query problem step by step.  First, I read the user's question carefully: "What are the elements of the toxicology and label of molecule TR060?" The extra knowledge provided mentions that TR060 is a molecule ID. So, the main goal is to find information related to this specific molecule.  Looking at the database schema, there are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. Each has its own structure and relationships.   I started by identifying which tables contain the necessary data. The molecule table has the label field, so that's where I can get the label for TR060. For the elements, the atom table stores each element associated with a molecule_id.  Since the question asks for the elements of the molecule TR060, I need to retrieve all atoms linked to this molecule ID. The atom table has a foreign key (molecule_id) referencing the molecule table's primary key (molecule_id). This means I can join these two tables on the molecule_id field.  I considered whether to use an INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. Since the user wants all elements for TR060, if there are no atoms, it would still show up with a NULL element. However, given that TR060 exists in the molecule table (even though I don't see it in the provided data), and assuming it has at least one atom, an INNER JOIN should suffice to retrieve all relevant elements.  Next, I thought about which columns to select. The label is directly from the molecule table's 'label' column. For elements, each row in the atom table represents an element of that molecule. So, selecting 'element' from the atom table will give me all elements associated with TR060.  I also considered if there might be multiple entries for the same element, but since each atom_id is unique and linked to a single molecule, each entry should represent a distinct atom's element. However, if the same element appears multiple times (like chlorine in the example), the query will return each occurrence separately.  Putting it all together, I structured the SQL query to select 'label' from molecule and 'element' from atom where the molecule_id matches TR060. Joining these two tables ensures that only related atoms are included.  I made sure to alias the columns for clarity: 'label' as 'Label' and 'element' as 'Element'. This makes the output more readable.  Finally, I double-checked the table relationships and structure to ensure there were no mistakes in the join or where clause. Everything seemed correct, so I finalized the query. </think>  SELECT molecule.label AS Label, atom.element AS Element  FROM molecule  INNER JOIN atom ON molecule.molecule_id = atom.molecule_id  WHERE molecule.molecule_id = 'TR060';
SELECT      bond_type,     COUNT(bond_type) AS count_bond_type,     MAX(COUNT(bond_type)) OVER() AS max_count FROM      bond WHERE      molecule_id = 'TR010' GROUP BY      bond_type;      SELECT      label FROM      molecule WHERE      molecule_id = 'TR010'; 
SELECT m.molecule_id  FROM molecule m  JOIN bond b ON m.molecule_id = b.molecule_id  WHERE m.label = '-' AND b.bond_type = '-'  GROUP BY m.molecule_id  ORDER BY m.molecule_id  LIMIT 3; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question asks for the top two bonds that happened with the molecule TR006 in alphabetical order.   First, let me understand the database schema provided. There are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule.  The 'bond' table has columns: bond_id (primary key), molecule_id, and bond_type. Each bond is associated with a molecule via molecule_id.  So, to get bonds related to TR006, I need to query the 'bond' table where molecule_id = 'TR006'.  But wait, looking at the inserted data in the bond table, I see entries like 'TR001_10_11' for TR001 and others. However, TR006 isn't present in the provided bond table inserts. That might mean there are no bonds for TR006 in the current dataset, or perhaps I need to consider that the user expects a query regardless of existing data.  Assuming that the molecule TR006 exists (as per the 'molecule' table), and possibly has some bonds, even if not shown here. So, the query should fetch all bond_ids from the bond table where molecule_id is 'TR006'.  The user wants the top two bonds in alphabetical order. Since SQL doesn't have a built-in way to limit results without using LIMIT (which isn't standard across all databases), but since the user didn't specify which SQL dialect, I'll proceed with LIMIT 2.  So, the steps are:  1. Select bond_id from the bond table. 2. Where molecule_id is 'TR006'. 3. Order them alphabetically by bond_id. 4. Limit to top two entries.  Putting it together, the SQL query would be:  SELECT bond_id FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR006' ORDER BY bond_id ASC LIMIT 2;  I should also consider if there are any case sensitivity issues with 'TR006', but since all entries in the schema use uppercase letters for IDs, I think it's safe.  Another thing to check: does the connected table play a role here? The user didn't mention it, so probably not. The question is about bonds directly linked to the molecule TR006. </think>  SELECT bond_id FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR006' ORDER BY bond_id ASC LIMIT 2;
<think> Okay, let me try to figure out how to answer this SQL question. The user is asking, "How many bonds which involved atom 12 does molecule TR009 have?" They've provided some extra information that TR009 is the molecule ID, and involved atom 12 refers to either atom_id or atom_id2 being 'TR009_12'.   First, I need to understand the database schema. There are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The relevant tables here seem to be connected and bond since bonds involve atoms through connections.  Looking at the connected table, it has three columns: atom_id, atom_id2, and bond_id. Each row represents a connection between two atoms via a bond. So, if I want to find all bonds that involve 'TR009_12', I need to check both atom_id and atom_id2 in this table.  The molecule is TR009, so the bond must belong to this molecule. The bond table has molecule_id as one of its columns, which links it back to the molecule. So, for each bond, we can check if molecule_id is 'TR009'.  Putting this together, I think I need to join the connected and bond tables. The connected table will help identify all bonds involved with atom 12, and then we'll filter those bonds by their molecule ID.  So the steps would be:  1. Filter the connected table for rows where either atom_id or atom_id2 is 'TR009_12'. 2. For each of these rows, get the bond_id. 3. Check in the bond table if that bond's molecule_id is 'TR009'. 4. Count how many such bonds exist.  In SQL terms, this would involve a SELECT COUNT statement with a JOIN between connected and bond on bond_id. We'll use WHERE clauses to filter for atom_12 and molecule TR009.  I should make sure that the conditions are correctly placed. The OR condition is needed in the WHERE clause for the two atom columns. Also, the join must be correct to link connected.bond_id with bond.bond_id.  Wait, I just realized that the molecule ID in the bond table needs to match TR009. So after joining, we have to ensure that bond.molecule_id is 'TR009'.   Putting it all together, the SQL should look like:  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM connected JOIN bond ON connected.bond_id = bond.bond_id WHERE (connected.atom_id = 'TR009_12' OR connected.atom_id2 = 'TR009_12') AND bond.molecule_id = 'TR009';  That should give the count of bonds involving atom 12 in molecule TR009. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM connected JOIN bond ON connected.bond_id = bond.bond_id WHERE (connected.atom_id = 'TR009_12' OR connected.atom_id2 = 'TR009_12') AND bond.molecule_id = 'TR009';
<think> Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user is asking how many molecules are both carcinogenic and contain the bromine element. From the schema and data provided, I need to construct an SQL query that returns this count.  First, understanding the terms: - **Carcinogenic**: According to the extra knowledge, a molecule with label '+' is carcinogenic. - **Bromine Element**: This means we're looking for atoms where the element is 'br'.  Looking at the database schema: 1. The `molecule` table has `molecule_id` and `label`. We'll use this to identify carcinogenic molecules (where label = '+'). 2. The `atom` table contains `atom_id`, `molecule_id`, and `element`. This is where we check for 'br' elements.  We need to join these two tables on `molecule_id` because each atom belongs to a molecule, identified by `molecule_id`.  The plan: - Join `molecule` and `atom` on `molecule_id`. - Filter rows where `label = '+'` (carcinogenic) and `element = 'br'`. - Count the distinct `molecule_id`s that meet these criteria to avoid counting duplicates.  Potential issues to consider: - Multiple atoms in a molecule might have 'br', but we only need each molecule counted once. - Ensuring that both conditions are applied correctly without missing any constraints.  Constructing the SQL query: 1. **SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id)**: This counts unique molecules that meet the criteria. 2. **FROM molecule m LEFT JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id**: Joins the two tables on `molecule_id`. 3. **WHERE m.label = '+' AND a.element = 'br'**: Filters for carcinogenic molecules with bromine atoms.  Double-checking: - The join is correct because both tables share `molecule_id`. - Using LEFT JOIN ensures we include all relevant atoms, but since we're counting distinct molecule_ids, it's efficient. - The WHERE clause correctly applies both conditions.  I think this should give the accurate count of molecules that are both carcinogenic and contain bromine. </think>  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) FROM molecule m LEFT JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id WHERE m.label = '+' AND a.element = 'br';
SELECT b.bond_type AS BondType, c.atom_id AS Atom1, c.atom_id2 AS Atom2  FROM bond b  JOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id  WHERE c.bond_id = 'TR001_6_9'; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the user's question using SQL. The question is asking which molecule the atom TR001_10 belongs to and whether that molecule is carcinogenic or not.  First, I'll look at the database schema provided. There are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The atom table has atom_id as the primary key, along with molecule_id and element. Molecule table has molecule_id and label.  The user mentioned that TR001_10 is an atom ID, so I need to find which molecule it's part of. That would be in the atom table since each atom is linked to a molecule via molecule_id.  Once I have the molecule_id from the atom table, I can query the molecule table to get the label. The user also noted that a '+' label means the molecule is carcinogenic. So if the label is '+', it's carcinogenic; otherwise, not.  Putting this together, my SQL should join the atom and molecule tables on molecule_id, filter for atom_id = 'TR001_10', and select the necessary columns.  Wait, but in the provided data, I don't see TR001_10 in the atom table. The atoms are TR000_1 to TR000_5. So this might be a test case or an assumption that TR001_10 exists elsewhere. But for writing the query, it doesn't matter; I just need to structure it correctly.  So the SQL should select molecule_id and label from atom joined with molecule where atom_id is 'TR001_10'. That way, it fetches the molecule information for that specific atom. </think>  SELECT `molecule`.`molecule_id`, `molecule`.`label` FROM `atom` JOIN `molecule` ON `atom`.`molecule_id` = `molecule`.`molecule_id` WHERE `atom`.`atom_
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT molecule_id) AS count FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '#'; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM connected WHERE atom_id LIKE 'TR%_19' OR atom_id2 LIKE 'TR%_19'; 
SELECT element FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR004'; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule WHERE label = '-'; 
<think> Alright, let's break down the problem step by step to understand how to arrive at the correct SQL query.  First, I need to address the user's question: "Among all the atoms from 21 to 25, list all the molecules that are carcinogenic."   From the provided database schema and extra knowledge: - Atoms with IDs from 21 to 25 can be identified using `SUBSTR(atom_id, 7, 2)`. This extracts a substring starting at position 7 for two characters. - Carcinogenic molecules have a label of '+', which is stored in the `molecule` table.  So, the steps are: 1. Extract atoms where the atom_id falls between '21' and '25' based on the specified substring. 2. Join these atoms with their respective molecules to determine if they're carcinogenic.  Now, looking at the tables: - The `atom` table contains `atom_id`, `molecule_id`, and `element`. - The `molecule` table has `molecule_id` and `label`.  The SQL query needs to select distinct `molecule_id` where `label` is '+', and ensure that the atoms involved are from 21 to 25.  Putting it together: - Use a subquery or WHERE clause to filter atoms based on the substring. - Join with `molecule` to check for the '+' label.  I realize that using `WHERE SUBSTR(atom_id,7,2) BETWEEN '21' AND '25'` directly in the query will correctly identify the relevant atoms. Then, joining with the `molecule` table ensures we only get those molecules marked as carcinogenic.  Finally, to avoid duplicates (since one molecule can have multiple atoms), I'll use `DISTINCT`.  So, the final SQL query selects distinct `molecule_id` from `molecule`, where there exists an atom in `atom` with the specified substring and linked by `molecule_id`. </think>  SELECT DISTINCT m.molecule_id FROM molecule m JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_ WHERE SUBSTR(a.atom_id,7,2) BETWEEN '21' AND '25' AND m.label = '+';
SELECT DISTINCT c.bond_id  FROM connected c  JOIN atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id  JOIN atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id  WHERE (a1.element = 'p' AND a2.element = 'n') OR (a1.element = 'n' AND a2.element = 'p'); 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question: "Is the molecule with the most double bonds carcinogenic?" They've also provided some extra knowledge that double bond refers to bond_type = '=', and label '+' means the molecule is carcinogenic.  First, let me understand the database schema. There are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The relevant ones here are bond and molecule because we're dealing with bonds (specifically double bonds) and their impact on whether a molecule is carcinogenic.  The user wants to know if the molecule that has the highest number of double bonds is carcinogenic. So, I need to find which molecule has the most double bonds and then check its label in the molecule table.  Let me break this down into steps:  1. **Identify Double Bonds**: From the bond table, select all entries where bond_type = '='. Each row here represents a double bond.  2. **Count Double Bonds per Molecule**: For each molecule_id, count how many times it appears in the above result. This will give me the number of double bonds per molecule.  3. **Find the Molecule with the Most Double Bonds**: Determine which molecule has the highest count from step 2.  4. **Check if That Molecule is Carcinogenic**: Look up the label for that molecule in the molecule table. If the label is '+', then it's carcinogenic.  Now, translating this into SQL:  - Use a SELECT statement with COUNT() to get the number of double bonds per molecule. - Order the results by this count in descending order so the top result is the molecule with the most double bonds. - Limit the result to one row since we only need the molecule with the highest count.  Once I have that molecule_id, I can join it with the molecule table to get its label and check if it's '+'.  Putting it all together:  1. **Subquery**: Use a subquery to find the top molecule by double bond count. 2. **Join**: Join this result with the molecule table to get the label.  I think using a Common Table Expression (CTE) might help here to make the query clearer, but since the user didn't specify any constraints on SQL features, I'll proceed without it for simplicity.  Wait, in the bond table, each double bond is represented once. So counting bond_id where bond_type='=' per molecule gives the correct count. But looking at the sample data, for example, TR001 has a double bond (TR001_10_11). Let me check if that's the only one.  Yes, in the provided data, there's only one double bond: 'TR001_10_11' with bond_type '='. So molecule TR001 would have 1 double bond. Other molecules like TR000 don't have any double bonds as per the given data.  But since the question is about the general case, my query should handle cases where multiple molecules can have varying numbers of double bonds.  Now, writing the SQL:  - Select molecule_id, count(bond_id) from bond where bond_type = '=', group by molecule_id. - Order by count desc, limit 1 to get the top molecule. - Then, check if this molecule's label is '+' in the molecule table.  So, combining these steps into one query using a subquery:  SELECT (SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_ id = ...) as is_carcinogenic.  Putting it all together, I think the final SQL should be something like selecting from molecule where the molecule_id equals the result of the top count query and then checking the label.  I'll need to structure this correctly to ensure that only one row is returned, which indicates whether the top molecule is carcinogenic. </think>  SELECT (SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id = (SELECT bond.molecule_id FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '=' GROUP BY molecule_id ORDER BY COUNT(bond_id) DESC LIMIT 1)) AS is_carcinogenic;

<think> Okay, so the user is asking for an SQL query that retrieves the bond types for atoms with the element Tin. From the knowledge provided, I know that 'element Tin' corresponds to element = 'sn'.   First, I need to figure out which tables are involved. The atom table has the element information, and the connected table links atoms via bonds. The bond table contains the bond_type.  I should start by selecting from the connected table since it's where the bonds between atoms are recorded. Each row in connected represents a connection between two atoms, and each has a bond_id. So I'll join connected with the atom table twice: once for each atom involved in the bond (atom_1 and atom_2).  The WHERE clause needs to check if either of the atoms is 'sn'. That means either atom_1's element is 'sn' or atom_2's element is 'sn'.  Next, I'll join with the bond table using bond_id to get the bond_type. Since each bond can connect multiple atoms, but we just need the type once per bond, adding DISTINCT ensures there are no duplicates.  Putting it all together: select distinct bond_type from connected, join with atom for both ends, and filter where either end is 'sn'. I should ensure that all joins are properly done to avoid any issues. </think>  SELECT DISTINCT `bond`.`bond_type` FROM `connected`  JOIN `atom` AS `atom1` ON `connected`.`atom_1` = `atom1`.`atom_id`  JOIN `atom` AS `atom2` ON `connected`.`atom_2` = `atom2`.`atom_id`  JOIN `bond` ON `connected`.`bond_id` = `bond`.`bond_id`  WHERE `atom1`.`element` = 'sn' OR `atom2`.`element` = 'sn';
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.element) AS num_elements  FROM atom a  JOIN bond b ON a.molecule_id = b.molecule_id  WHERE b.bond_type = '-'; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM atom WHERE element IN ('p', 'br') AND molecule_id IN (SELECT DISTINCT molecule_id FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '#'); 
<think> Alright, let's tackle this SQL problem step by step. The user wants a query that retrieves bond IDs for molecules that are carcinogenic. From the extra knowledge provided, I know that a molecule is carcinogenic if its label is '+'.  First, I need to figure out which tables contain the necessary information. The 'molecule' table has the label field, and each molecule has multiple bonds stored in the 'bond' table. Both tables are connected through the 'molecule_id' field.  So, my approach should be: 1. Select all molecules where the label is '+'. 2. For those molecules, retrieve their corresponding bond IDs.  To achieve this, I'll use a JOIN between the 'bond' and 'molecule' tables on the 'molecule_id'. Then, in the WHERE clause, I'll filter for molecules with a label of '+'.  I should make sure that the query is efficient without unnecessary columns. Since we only need the bond IDs, the SELECT statement will include 'bond.bond_id'.  Putting it all together, the SQL query should join the two tables and apply the condition on the label. That way, it returns exactly the bond IDs for carcinogenic molecules. </think>  SELECT bond.bond_id FROM bond JOIN molecule ON bond.molecule_id = molecule.molecule_id WHERE molecule.label = '+';
SELECT m.molecule_id FROM `bond` AS b  JOIN `molecule` AS m ON b.molecule_id = m.molecule_id  WHERE b.bond_type = '-' AND m.label = '-'; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question: "What is the composition of element chlorine in percentage among the single bond molecules?"   First, let's break down what each part means. The element chlorine refers to atoms where the 'element' column is 'cl'. Single bond molecules are those where the 'bond_type' is '-'. The goal is to find the percentage of chlorine elements relative to all atoms in these single-bonded molecules.  Looking at the database schema, there are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule.   The 'atom' table has 'atom_id', 'molecule_id', and 'element'. Each row represents an atom in a specific molecule and its element type.  The 'bond' table contains 'bond_id', 'molecule_id', and 'bond_type'. This tells us about the bonds present in each molecule.  The 'connected' table links atoms through their bond IDs, showing which atoms are connected by which bonds. However, since each bond is represented twice (once for each atom), I might not need this table directly because the bonds can be linked via 'molecule_id'.  The 'molecule' table has 'molecule_id' and a 'label', but it doesn't seem to affect our calculation here.  To get all single-bond molecules, I'll focus on the 'bond' table where 'bond_type' is '-'. Each bond belongs to a molecule, so I can group by 'molecule_id' in the 'bond' table. However, each molecule might have multiple bonds, so I need to ensure that only those with at least one single bond are considered.  Wait, but the question is about all atoms in molecules that have single bonds. So, any molecule that has a '-' bond should be included. But maybe some molecules have both '-' and '=' bonds? The problem says "among the single bond molecules," which might mean considering only those molecules where all bonds are single? Or perhaps it's any molecule that has at least one single bond. The user's extra knowledge clarifies that single bond refers to 'bond_type' = '-', so I think we're looking for all atoms in molecules that have at least one single bond.  But actually, the percentage is calculated as (sum of Cl atoms) / (total number of atoms) where the molecule has bonds of type '-'. So, perhaps it's considering each atom in any molecule that has a '-' bond. Or maybe each atom in molecules where all bonds are '-'? That could complicate things, but given the extra knowledge, I think it's about molecules with at least one single bond.  Wait, no. The user provided an example for percentage calculation: SUM(element='cl') divided by COUNT(atom_id) where bond_type is '-'. Hmm, perhaps each atom is counted if their molecule has a '-' bond.  But how to link this correctly? Each atom belongs to a molecule, and the molecule can have multiple bonds. So I need to find all atoms in molecules that have at least one single bond.  So the steps are:  1. Identify all molecules that have at least one bond of type '-'. This is because each bond in the 'bond' table has a 'molecule_id', so we can get distinct molecule_ids where 'bond_type' is '-'.  2. For these molecules, count how many atoms have element 'cl'.  3. Also, count the total number of atoms in these molecules.  4. The percentage is (sum_cl / total_atoms) * 100.  So, to structure this:  - First, get all molecule_ids from the 'bond' table where bond_type is '-'. Let's call this subset M.  - Then, for each molecule in M, count the number of atoms with element 'cl'.  - Sum these counts across all molecules in M to get sum_cl.  - Also, count the total number of atoms (regardless of element) in all molecules in M. This is total_atoms.  Then, calculate percentage as (sum_cl / total_atoms) * 100.  Now, translating this into SQL:  We can use a subquery to first get all molecule_ids with bond_type '-'. Then, join the 'atom' table on these molecule_ids and aggregate accordingly.  So, the SQL would involve:  SELECT      SUM(CASE WHEN element = 'cl' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(atom_id) * 100 AS percent FROM      atom WHERE      molecule_id IN (SELECT molecule_id FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '-');  Wait, but this approach might double count if a molecule has multiple bonds of type '-', as each 'molecule_id' would be included once in the subquery. However, joining on 'molecule_id' in the 'atom' table ensures that all atoms from those molecules are considered.  Another way is to group by molecule_id in the subquery and then include only distinct molecule_ids, but since we're using IN, it's fine as it will consider each molecule once regardless of how many single bonds they have.  Wait, no. The subquery (SELECT molecule_id FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '-') might return multiple rows for the same molecule if it has multiple '-' bonds. But in the WHERE clause, 'molecule_id IN (...)' treats each occurrence as a separate entry, but for the purpose of checking existence, it's redundant because once a molecule is included, all its atoms are considered.  But since we're using IN, any duplicates in the subquery don't affect the result; it still includes all atoms from molecules that have at least one '-' bond. So the approach should work.  Alternatively, to avoid possible performance issues with duplicate molecule_ids in the subquery, perhaps use a DISTINCT:  SELECT      SUM(CASE WHEN element = 'cl' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(atom_id) * 100 AS percent FROM      atom WHERE      molecule_id IN (SELECT DISTINCT molecule_id FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '-');  But in the initial setup, it's not necessary unless there are duplicates that could cause issues. However, using DISTINCT ensures we're only checking each molecule once.  Another consideration: What if a molecule has multiple bonds of type '-', but also other types? It still counts because it has at least one single bond.  So, putting it all together:  SELECT      SUM(CASE WHEN element = 'cl' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(atom_id) * 100 AS percent FROM      atom WHERE      molecule_id IN (SELECT DISTINCT molecule_id FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '-');  Wait, but the user's example in the extra knowledge says:  percentage = SUM(element='cl') / COUNT(atom_id) where bond_type = '-'  Which suggests that each atom is considered if their molecule has a '-' bond. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider all atoms from molecules that have at least one '-', which aligns with what I've written.  Alternatively, another way could be to join 'atom' and 'bond' tables directly, but we need to ensure that for each atom, there exists at least one bond of type '-' in their molecule. However, this approach would require grouping by molecule_id and ensuring that the condition is met.  Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use an EXISTS clause or a JOIN with a subquery that ensures each atom's molecule has at least one '-' bond.  But considering SQL structure, the initial approach should work as intended. </think>  SELECT      (SUM(CASE WHEN element = 'cl' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(atom_id)) * 100 AS percent FROM      atom WHERE      molecule_id IN (SELECT DISTINCT molecule_id FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '-');
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The user is asking for the labels of TR000, TR001, and TR002. From the extra knowledge provided, these are molecule IDs in the database.  First, I'll look at the database schema. There's a table called 'molecule' with columns 'molecule_id' and 'label'. The data shows that each entry has a molecule ID and its corresponding label, which is either '+' or '-' indicating carcinogenicity.  So, to get the labels for these specific molecule IDs, I need to select the 'label' column from the 'molecule' table where the 'molecule_id' matches TR000, TR001, or TR002.   I should use the WHERE clause with the IN operator to specify all three IDs in a single query. That way, I can retrieve the labels efficiently without writing multiple SELECT statements.  Putting it all together, the SQL query will select 'label' from 'molecule' where 'molecule_id' is one of TR000, TR001, or TR002. This should give me the desired information directly. </think>  SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id IN ('TR000', 'TR001', 'TR002');
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that lists down the molecule IDs for non-carcinogenic molecules based on the provided database schema and data. Let me break this down step by step.  First, from the user's question, they want a list of molecule IDs where the molecules are non-carcinogenic. The extra knowledge given is crucial here: if the 'label' column in the 'molecule' table has a value of '-', that indicates the molecule is non-carcinogenic. So my main focus should be on filtering the 'molecule' table based on this label.  Looking at the schema, there's a 'molecule' table with columns 'molecule_id' and 'label'. The other tables like 'atom', 'bond', and 'connected' don't seem necessary for this particular query because we're only concerned with the molecule's label. Therefore, I can directly query the 'molecule' table without needing joins.  The next step is to write a SELECT statement that retrieves the 'molecule_id' from the 'molecule' table where the 'label' is '-'. The SQL syntax for this would involve selecting the specific column and applying a WHERE clause to filter the results.  I should also ensure that the query doesn't include any comments, as per the user's instruction. So, the final SQL statement will be straightforward, selecting the required column with the condition specified.  To summarize, my approach is: 1. Identify the relevant table ('molecule') based on the requirement. 2. Determine the necessary columns to select ('molecule_id'). 3. Apply the filter using the WHERE clause to get only non-carcinogenic molecules (label = '-').  I don't see any other complexities here since the query doesn't require joining tables or handling more complicated conditions. The provided data in the tables also supports this approach, as all necessary information is present in the 'molecule' table. </think>  SELECT molecule_id FROM molecule WHERE label = '-';
SELECT COUNT(molecule_id) AS total_carcinogenic_molecules FROM molecule WHERE label = '+' AND molecule_id BETWEEN 'TR000' AND 'TR030'; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The user wants a list of bond types for molecules from molecule_id TR000 to TR050.  First, looking at the database schema, there are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The relevant table here is 'bond' because it contains bond_type information linked to molecule_id.  The user's question mentions a range of molecule_ids from TR000 to TR050. So I need to filter the bond records where molecule_id falls within that range. In SQL, using the BETWEEN operator makes this straightforward.  I should select the bond_type column from the bond table where molecule_id is between 'TR000' and 'TR050'. Since the bond_type has specific values like '=', '-', or '#', I don't need any joins because all necessary information is in the bond table.  So, the query will be a SELECT statement that retrieves bond_type from the bond table with a WHERE clause specifying molecule_id between TR000 and TR050. </think>  SELECT bond_type FROM bond WHERE molecule_id BETWEEN 'TR000' AND 'TR050';
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that retrieves the elements for the bond with ID 'TR001_10_11'. Let me start by understanding the database schema and the relationships between the tables.  First, looking at the tables provided:  1. **Atom Table**: This table has atom_id (primary key), molecule_id, and element. Each row represents an atom in a molecule.  2. **Bond Table**: Contains bond_id (primary key), molecule_id, and bond_type. Each entry is a bond between atoms in a molecule.  3. **Connected Table**: This seems to link atoms with bonds. It has atom_id, atom_id2, and bond_id as primary keys. So each row connects two atoms via a specific bond.  4. **Molecule Table**: Stores molecule_id and label, which I assume is used for categorizing molecules (like positive or negative charge).  The question is asking for the elements involved in the bond 'TR001_10_11'. To get this information, I need to find out which atoms are connected by this bond and then retrieve their elements.  Here's how I can approach it step by step:  - **Identify the Bond**: The bond ID is given as 'TR001_10_11'. So first, I should check if this exists in the bond table. From the data provided, yes, there's an entry for this bond.  - **Find Connected Atoms**: Using the connected table, which links atoms to bonds via bond_id. For each row with bond_id 'TR001_10_11', I can get atom_ids of both ends of the bond.  Wait, looking at the data provided, I notice that in the connected table, there are only entries for TR000_* bonds. There's no entry for 'TR001_10_11'. That might be an oversight or perhaps it's just not included in the sample data. But assuming that in a real scenario, this bond exists in the connected table, I can proceed.  - **Retrieve Elements of Connected Atoms**: Once I have both atom_ids from the connected table, I can join them with the atom table to get their elements.  So putting it all together:  1. Start by selecting from the connected table where bond_id is 'TR001_10_11'. 2. For each atom_id in this result, look up its element in the atom table. 3. Since a bond connects two atoms, I need to get both elements.  In SQL terms, I can write a query that joins the connected table with the atom table twice: once for atom_id and once for atom_id2.  The structure would be:  SELECT      a.element,     b.element FROM      connected c JOIN      atom a ON c.atom_id = a.atom_id JOIN      atom b ON c.atom_id2 = b.atom_id WHERE      c.bond_id = 'TR001_10_11';  This should give me both elements involved in the bond.  Wait, but since the connected table has two rows for each connection (like TR000_1 and TR000_2), would this cause duplicate entries? In my sample data, I see that for 'TR000_1_2', there are two entries: one with atom_id as TR000_1 and another with TR000_2. So when querying, each bond would return two rows if the connected table is structured this way.  But in reality, each bond connects exactly two atoms, so I should only need to retrieve both elements once. Perhaps using a more efficient query that gets unique pairs.  Alternatively, maybe I can use a DISTINCT clause or ensure that each pair is only returned once, but given the structure of the connected table, it might not be necessary if we're just looking for the two elements.  Another consideration: what if the bond doesn't exist in the connected table? Then the query would return nothing. But since the user provided that 'TR001_10_11' is a valid bond ID, I can assume it exists.  Putting all this together, my final SQL query should select both elements from the atoms involved in the specified bond. </think>  SELECT a.element AS element1, b.element AS element2 FROM connected c JOIN atom a ON c.atom_id = a.atom_id JOIN atom b ON c.atom_id2 = b.atom_id WHERE c.bond_id = 'TR001_10_11';  The SQL query joins the `connected` table with the `atom` table twice to retrieve the elements of both atoms involved in the bond specified by 'TR001_10_11'. This effectively fetches the two elements connected by that bond.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.bond_id) AS iodine_bonds_count FROM connected c JOIN atom a ON c.atom_id = a.atom_id WHERE a.element = 'i'; 
SELECT CASE      WHEN COUNT(CASE(label WHEN '+' THEN 1 END)) > COUNT(CASE(label WHEN '-' THEN 1 END))      THEN 'mostly carcinogenic'      ELSE 'mostly non-carcinogenic'  END AS result FROM (     SELECT DISTINCT m.molecule_id, m.label     FROM atom a     JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id     WHERE a.element = 'ca' ) sub; 
SELECT * FROM connected  JOIN atom ON connected.atom_id = atom.atom_id  WHERE connected.bond_id = 'TR001_1_8' GROUP BY connected.bond_id  HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN element = 'cl' THEN 1 END) > 0 AND COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN element = 'c' THEN 1 END) > 0; 
SELECT DISTINCT m.molecule_id  FROM molecule m  JOIN bond b ON m.molecule_id = b.molecule_id  JOIN atom a ON b.molecule_id = a.molecule_id  WHERE m.label = '-' AND b.bond_type = '#' AND a.element = 'c'; 
<think> Alright, let's try to figure out how to answer the question: "What is the percentage of element chlorine in carcinogenic molecules?"   First, I need to understand what each part means. Chlorine here refers to elements where the element is 'cl'. Carcinogenic molecules are those with a label of '+', as per the extra knowledge provided.  The goal is to find the percentage of chlorine atoms in all atoms within these carcinogenic molecules. So, I think we need two main numbers: the count of chlorine atoms and the total number of atoms in carcinogenic molecules.  Looking at the database schema, the 'atom' table has the element information and is linked to 'molecule' through 'molecule_id'. The 'molecule' table tells us which are carcinogenic with the label '+'.  So, I'll start by selecting from the 'atom' table where the molecule's label is '+'. For each atom in these molecules, if the element is 'cl', it contributes to our numerator. The total number of atoms (regardless of element) will be our denominator.  I can use a CASE statement to count how many times 'cl' appears and then sum that up. At the same time, I'll count all atoms to get the total. Then, divide these two numbers to get the percentage.  I should group by molecule_id because each atom belongs to a specific molecule, and we need to consider each molecule's contribution separately before aggregating across all carcinogenic molecules.  Wait, actually, since each atom is part of a molecule, but the question seems to ask for the overall percentage across all atoms in all carcinogenic molecules. So maybe grouping isn't necessary unless I want to calculate per molecule, which doesn't seem to be the case here.  So, I'll write a query that selects from 'atom' where the molecule's label is '+'. For each atom, check if the element is 'cl' and sum those up. Then count all atoms in these molecules. Finally, divide the sum by the total count to get the percentage.  I think the SQL should look something like:  SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN element = 'cl' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS percentage FROM atom WHERE molecule_id IN (SELECT molecule_id FROM molecule WHERE label = '+');  Hmm, but wait, in the extra knowledge example, it said to use SUM(element='pb') and COUNT(molecule_id). But in our case, it's chlorine, so 'cl'. Also, molecule_id is per molecule, but we need atoms across all molecules. So perhaps the correct approach is to count all 'cl' atoms divided by total atoms in all carcinogenic molecules.  Yes, that makes sense. So the query should:  1. Join 'atom' with 'molecule' on molecule_id. 2. Filter for molecules where label = '+'. 3. For each atom in these molecules, check if element is 'cl'. 4. Sum those 'cl's and divide by total number of atoms.  I think that's correct. So the SQL would be:  SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN a.element = 'cl' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(a.atom_id)) * 100 AS percentage FROM atom a JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE m.label = '+';  Wait, but in the extra knowledge example, they used SUM(element='pb') and COUNT(molecule_id). But here, we're counting atoms, not molecules. So I think using COUNT(a.atom_id) is correct because each atom is an individual entry.  Alternatively, since each row in 'atom' represents one atom, COUNT(*) would also work as it counts the number of rows.  I think that's the right approach. Let me put it all together. </think>  SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN element = 'cl' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS percentage FROM atom a JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE m.label = '+';
SELECT DISTINCT element FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR001'; 
SELECT molecule_id FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '='; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that returns the atom IDs of the first and second atoms in molecules where there's a triple bond. Let me break this down step by step.  First, let's understand what each table contains:  - The `atom` table has information about individual atoms, including their IDs, which molecule they belong to, and the element type. - The `bond` table stores details about bonds between atoms, such as the bond ID, the molecule it belongs to, and the type of bond (like single, double, triple). - The `connected` table links two atoms via a bond, indicating that these atoms are connected by the specified bond.  The user's question specifically asks for the atom IDs (both first and second) in molecules where there is a triple bond. From the extra knowledge provided: - A triple bond corresponds to `bond_type = '#'`. - The "first atom" refers to `atom_id` in the `connected` table. - The "second atom" refers to `atom_id2`.  So, my goal is to find all entries in the `connected` table that are associated with a bond of type '#'.   Here's how I can approach this:  1. **Identify Bonds with Triple Type**: I need to query the `bond` table where `bond_type = '#'`. This will give me all bond IDs that represent triple bonds.  2. **Join with Connected Table**: Once I have these bond IDs, I should join them with the `connected` table using the `bond_id` foreign key. This will allow me to get the corresponding `atom_id` and `atom_id2` for each of these bonds.  3. **Select Required Columns**: From the `connected` table, I need to select both `atom_id` (first atom) and `atom_id2` (second atom).  Putting this together, the SQL query should first filter the bonds for triple types and then retrieve the connected atoms from those bonds.  I should make sure that there are no syntax errors. Also, since the user only wants the SQL with no comments, I need to ensure the final output is clean without any explanations or notes. </think>  SELECT `atom_id`, `atom_id2` FROM `connected` WHERE `bond_id` IN (SELECT `bond_
<think> Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for the toxicology elements associated with a specific bond ID, TR000_1_2.  First, I need to understand the database schema provided. There are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule.   The atom table has columns like atom_id, molecule_id, and element. Each row represents an atom in a molecule. The bond table includes bond_id, molecule_id, and bond_type, showing how atoms are connected. The connected table links atom_ids with their bonds, indicating which atoms are bonded together. Lastly, the molecule table lists each molecule by its ID and label.  The user wants to find elements (like 'cl', 'c', etc.) from the atoms that are part of a specific bond. So, I need to connect these tables appropriately.  Starting from the connected table since it holds the bond_id we're interested in. The bond_id TR000_1_2 is present here and links two atom_ids: TR000_1 and TR000_2.   To get the elements of these atoms, I'll need to join the connected table with the atom table on their atom_ids. However, each connected record has an atom_id and atom_id2, so both need to be considered.  I should use a UNION ALL to combine the results from both atom_id and atom_id2 columns because they represent two sides of the same bond. This way, I can retrieve all elements associated with that particular bond without missing any due to duplication.  So, the query will select the element where either atom_id or atom_id2 in the connected table matches TR000_1_2. Joining each part separately ensures both atoms involved in the bond are accounted for.  I also need to make sure the SQL is clean and only includes necessary parts without any comments as per the user's instruction. </think>  SELECT element FROM `atom` WHERE atom_id IN (SELECT atom_id FROM `connected` WHERE bond_id = 'TR000_1_2')   UNION ALL   SELECT element FROM `atom` WHERE atom_id IN (SELECT atom_id2 FROM `connected` WHERE bond_id = 'TR000_1_2');
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) AS count_non_carcinogenic_single_bond_molecules FROM molecule m JOIN bond b ON m.molecule_id = b.molecule_id WHERE m.label = '-' AND b.bond_type = '-'; 
SELECT m.label FROM molecule m JOIN bond b ON m.molecule_id = b.molecule_id WHERE b.bond_id = 'TR001_10_11'; 
SELECT b.bond_id, m.label  FROM bond b  INNER JOIN molecule m ON b.molecule_id = m.molecule_id  WHERE b.bond_type = '#'; 
SELECT      atom.element, COUNT(atom.element) AS tally  FROM      molecule  JOIN      atom ON molecule.molecule_id = atom.molecule_aid  WHERE      molecule.label = '+'      AND substr(atom.atom_aid, 7, 1) = '4'  GROUP BY      atom.element; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for the ratio of Hydrogen elements in molecule ID TR006 and list it with its label.  First, let me break down what the user wants. They want two things: the ratio of hydrogen atoms and the label associated with molecule TR006.  Looking at the database schema, there are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The relevant tables here are 'atom' and 'molecule'.   The 'atom' table has columns atom_id, molecule_id, and element. The 'molecule' table has molecule_id and label. So to get the ratio of hydrogen in TR006, I'll need to query the 'atom' table where molecule_id is 'TR006'.  Hydrogen refers to element = 'h'. The ratio is calculated as the sum of elements equal to 'h' divided by the total count of elements for that molecule. So, I can use a CASE statement to count how many times 'h' appears and then divide it by the total number of atoms.  I should also get the label from the 'molecule' table where molecule_id is TR006. Since the ratio calculation needs to be specific to TR006, I'll join the 'atom' and 'molecule' tables on molecule_id.  Putting this together, I can use a SELECT statement that includes a CASE for hydrogen count, divide it by the total count of elements where molecule_id is TR006. Then, I can include the label from the 'molecule' table using an inner join to ensure we only get data for TR006.  I should also alias the calculated ratio as something clear like 'hydrogen_ratio' and the label as 'label'. Using COUNT with CASE will give me the number of hydrogens. Dividing that by the total count (without case) gives the ratio.  Finally, to ensure we only get one row for TR006, I'll include a WHERE clause on molecule_id = 'TR006' and use LIMIT 1.  So, putting it all together: select the calculated ratio and label from atom joined with molecule where molecule_id is TR006. The calculation uses CASE to count hydrogens divided by total elements in that molecule. </think>  SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN element = 'h' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(element)) AS hydrogen_ratio, m.label FROM atom a INNER JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE a.molecule_id = 'TR006' GROUP BY a.molecule_id;
SELECT m.molecule_id, m.label  FROM molecule m  JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id  WHERE a.element = 'ca'; 
<think> Alright, I need to determine the bond type in a chemical compound that contains Carbon. Let me break this down step by step.  First, the user is asking about bonds formed in compounds where one of the elements is Carbon. So, my focus should be on any molecule that has at least one Carbon atom.  Looking at the database schema, there are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The atom table holds information about each atom, including its element. The bond table lists all bonds along with their types. The connected table links atoms via bonds, showing which atoms are bonded together. The molecule table is just for keeping track of different molecules.  So, to find the bond type when Carbon is involved, I need to connect these tables. Here's how I can approach it:  1. **Identify Molecules with Carbon**: Start by finding all molecules that have at least one atom where the element is 'c'. This will give me a list of molecule IDs.  2. **Find Bonds in Those Molecules**: Once I have the molecule IDs, I need to look into the bond table for those specific molecules and note down their bond types.  3. **Link Atoms via Bonds**: The connected table shows which atoms are bonded together using a specific bond ID. But since I'm focusing on Carbon-containing compounds, I can use the atom table to ensure that at least one of the atoms in each bond is Carbon.  Putting this together, I'll need to join the tables appropriately. The atom and bond tables are both linked through the molecule_id. So, I can start by joining atom with bond via their molecule_ids.  Wait, but actually, each bond belongs to a molecule, so if I have the molecule IDs that contain Carbon, I can directly query the bonds in those molecules without needing the connected table unless I need more specific information about which atoms are bonded. But since the question is just about the bond type when Carbon is involved, maybe I don't need the connected table.  However, perhaps it's better to ensure that the bond is indeed between two atoms, at least one of which is Carbon. So, I might need to involve the connected table to make sure that the bonds we're considering are those where one atom is Carbon.  So here's a revised plan:  - **Step 1**: Find all molecule IDs where there exists an atom with element 'c'. This can be done by selecting distinct molecule_ids from the atom table where element = 'c'.  - **Step 2**: For each of these molecules, select all bonds. Since each bond in a molecule is part of that molecule's structure, this should give me all relevant bonds.  - **Step 3**: Ensure that each bond connects at least one Carbon atom. To do this, for each bond_id in the selected bonds, check through the connected table to see if either atom_id or atom_id2 has an element 'c'.   Wait, but the connected table links two atoms via a bond. So, for each bond, I need to verify that at least one of the connected atoms is Carbon.  So, perhaps a better approach is:  - Find all bonds where the molecule_id contains at least one Carbon atom, and then ensure that in their connections, there's at least one Carbon atom involved.  But this might complicate things because a bond could be between two non-Carbon atoms even if the molecule has Carbon elsewhere. So, perhaps it's more accurate to find bonds where either of the connected atoms is Carbon.  Alternatively, since the question is about bonds formed in compounds containing Carbon, maybe any bond within such a molecule counts, regardless of whether both atoms are Carbon or not. But I think the user wants bonds that involve Carbon atoms specifically.  So, perhaps the correct approach is:  1. Get all atoms where element = 'c'. Their atom_ids will be part of the connected table.  2. For these atoms, find all bonds they're connected to via the connected table.  3. From those bonds, extract their bond_type.  This way, we ensure that the bonds are indeed involving Carbon atoms.  Let me structure this:  - Start by selecting distinct atom_id from atom where element = 'c'.  - Then, for each of these atom_ids, look into the connected table to find all bond_ids they're involved in.  - From bond table, get the bond_type for those bond_ids.  This approach ensures that only bonds involving Carbon atoms are considered.  Alternatively, using joins:  SELECT DISTINCT b.bond_type FROM atom a JOIN connected c ON a.atom_id = c.atom_id OR a.atom_id = c.atom_id2 JOIN bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id WHERE a.element = 'c';  But wait, does this cover all cases? If an atom is Carbon and it's bonded via a certain bond, then yes. But if the molecule has multiple Carbon atoms, each would contribute to their bonds.  Another approach could be:  SELECT DISTINCT b.bond_type FROM bond b JOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id JOIN atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id OR c.atom_id2 = a1.atom_id WHERE a1.element = 'c';  But this might not be necessary because if either atom in the connection is Carbon, then the bond involves Carbon.  Alternatively, maybe it's simpler to find all bonds in molecules that have at least one Carbon atom. But that could include bonds between non-Carbon atoms within those molecules, which may not be what the user wants.  So perhaps focusing on bonds that involve at least one Carbon atom is more accurate.  In that case, the SQL would look like:  SELECT DISTINCT b.bond_type FROM bond b JOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id JOIN atom a ON (c.atom_id = a.atom_id OR c.atom_id2 = a.atom_id) WHERE a.element = 'c';  This ensures that each selected bond is between at least one Carbon atom and another atom.  Alternatively, perhaps using the connected table to check both ends:  SELECT DISTINCT b.bond_type FROM bond b JOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id WHERE EXISTS (     SELECT 1 FROM atom a WHERE (c.atom_id = a.atom_id OR c.atom_id2 = a.atom_id) AND a.element = 'c' );  But this might be more complex than necessary.  I think the first approach is sufficient: join the connected table with the atom where element is 'c', and then get the bond_type from those bonds.  So, putting it all together, the SQL would select distinct bond_types from bonds that are connected to at least one Carbon atom. </think>  SELECT DISTINCT b.bond_type FROM bond b JOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id JOIN atom a ON (c.atom_id = a.atom_id OR c.atom_id2 = a.atom_id) WHERE a.element = 'c';
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write the SQL query for the question: "Name chemical elements that form a bond TR001_10_11."   First, I'll start by understanding what each part of the question is asking. The user wants to know which chemical elements are involved in the specific bond with ID 'TR001_10_11'.   Looking at the database schema provided, there's a `bond` table that contains information about bonds, including their IDs and types. The `connected` table links atoms via bonds, and the `atom` table has details about each atom, including their element.  The extra knowledge section explains how to parse the bond ID. For 'TR001_10_11', the molecule ID is the first 5 characters, which would be 'TR001'. The first atom (atom1) is derived from the next two digits after the underscore, so positions 7-8 give '10'. Similarly, atom2 is the last two digits, giving '11'.  So, my approach should involve: 1. Extracting the bond ID to get molecule_id, atom1, and atom2. 2. Using these extracted IDs to find the corresponding atoms in the `connected` table. 3. Joining with the `atom` table to retrieve their elements.  I'll need to use string functions like SUBSTR to parse the bond_ id. Then, I can join the `bond`, `connected`, and `atom` tables to get the element information for both atoms involved in that specific bond.  Another point is that each bond connects two atoms, so I should retrieve elements from both atom1 and atom2. The result will list both elements for the given bond.  Putting it all together, the SQL query will extract the necessary parts of the bond ID, find the connected atoms, and then fetch their elements. </think>  SELECT a.element AS element_1, a2.element AS element_2 FROM connected c JOIN atom a ON c.atom_id = a.atom_id JOIN atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id WHERE c.bond_id = 'TR001_10_11';
SELECT      ( (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT molecule_id) FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '#') * 100.0 ) /      (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule) AS percentage; 
SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN bond_type = '=' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(bond_id)) * 100 AS percent FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR047'; 
SELECT m.label FROM molecule m JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id WHERE a.atom_id = 'TR001_1'; 
SELECT * FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id = 'TR151' AND label = '+'; 
<think> Alright, let's try to figure out how to answer the question: "Which toxic element can be found in the molecule TR151?"   First, I need to understand the database schema provided. There are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule.  The molecule table has a primary key called molecule_id and a label column. Looking at the inserts, it seems that some molecules have labels like '+' or '-', but I'm not sure what those represent yet.  The atom table contains information about individual atoms in each molecule. It has atom_ id (primary key), molecule_ id (foreign key referencing molecule), and element which denotes the chemical symbol of the atom. The inserts show examples where elements are 'cl', 'c', etc., which correspond to different elements as per the provided extra knowledge.  The bond table contains information about bonds between atoms, with bond_ id, molecule_ id, and bond_ type, which might indicate single or double bonds based on the '-' or '=' symbols in the inserts.  The connected table seems to link atoms via their bonds. Each entry shows two atom IDs and a bond ID connecting them. This probably represents undirected edges since each connection is listed twice (e.g., TR000_1 and TR000_2 are connected both ways).  Now, the user's question is about finding toxic elements in molecule TR151. From the extra knowledge provided, certain elements are considered toxic, such as 'cl' for Chlorine, 'pb' for Lead, etc.  Looking at the current data, all the molecules have IDs like TR000, TR001, up to TR006. There's no mention of TR151 in the inserts provided. So, if I were to query this database with molecule_id = 'TR151', it might not return any results because that data isn't present.  However, assuming that TR151 exists in a larger dataset beyond the sample provided, my approach would be:  1. **Identify Toxic Elements**: From the extra knowledge, elements like 'cl' (Chlorine), 'pb' (Lead), etc., are toxic. So I need to check if any of these elements are present in molecule TR151.  2. **Query Structure**:    - Use the atom table since it contains element information.    - Filter by molecule_ id = 'TR151'.    - Check for elements that are considered toxic.  3. **SQL Construction**: The query should select the element from the atom table where molecule_ id is 'TR151' and the element is one of the known toxic ones.  But since in this specific dataset, TR151 isn't present, executing such a query would return nothing. However, structuring the SQL correctly is important for when TR151 data is available.  So, putting it all together, the SQL statement should select the element from the atom table where the molecule_id is 'TR151' and the element is in the list of toxic elements provided. </think>  SELECT element FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR151';
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.  The user wants to know how many chemical compounds in the database are identified as carcinogenic. From the extra knowledge provided, I remember that a label of '+' indicates that a molecule is carcinogenic. So, my task is to count all molecules with a label of '+'.   Looking at the database schema, there's a table called 'molecule' which has columns 'molecule_id' and 'label'. Each row in this table represents a chemical compound. The 'label' column determines if it's carcinogenic or not.  So, I need to query the 'molecule' table where the 'label' is '+', and count how many such entries there are.   I should use the COUNT() function for this purpose. The SQL syntax would be something like:  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule WHERE label = '+';   Wait, does that cover everything? Let me double-check. The 'molecule' table has each compound once, right? So counting where the label is '+' should give the correct number of carcinogenic compounds.  I don't think I need to join any tables because all the necessary information is in the 'molecule' table itself. The other tables like 'atom', 'bond', and 'connected' contain details about atoms and bonds within molecules, but since the question only asks about the count based on the label, those aren't needed here.  Also, I should ensure that the SQL syntax is correct. Using COUNT(*) will give me the total number of rows that meet the condition. The WHERE clause filters the results to only include those with a '+' label.  Is there anything else I need to consider? Maybe case sensitivity? But in this case, all labels are provided as '+', so it's consistent. Therefore, no issues here.  So, putting it all together, the SQL query should select from the 'molecule' table, count all entries where the label is '+'. That should give me the number of carcinogenic compounds. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule WHERE label = '+';
<think> Okay, so I need to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me break it down step by step.  First, the question is asking to identify atoms that belong to molecules with IDs between TR010 and TR050 and contain the element carbon.   Looking at the database schema, there are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The relevant tables here are 'atom' and 'molecule'. The 'atom' table has columns atom_id, molecule_id, and element. The 'molecule' table has molecule_id and label.  The user mentioned that carbon refers to element = 'c', so I need to filter atoms where the element is 'c'.   Next, the molecule ID needs to be between TR010 and TR050. The user provided a hint on how to handle this using substr. Specifically, they want substr(molecule_id, 3, 3) >= 10 and <=50. This makes sense because for IDs like TR010, the substring starting at position 3 for three characters gives '010', which is 10 when converted to a number.  So, I'll need to join the atom table with the molecule table on molecule_id. Then, apply the two conditions: element = 'c' and the substring condition on molecule_id.  Putting it all together, the SQL query should select from atom where there's a match in the molecule table for the given ID range and the element is carbon. </think>  SELECT a.atom_id FROM atom a JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE a.element = 'c' AND  SUBSTR(m.molecule_id, 3, 3) >= 10 AND SUBSTR(m.molecule_id, 3, 3) <=50;
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to answer the user's question using SQL. The question is asking, "How many atoms belong to the molecule labeled with carcinogenic compounds?"   First, from the extra knowledge provided, I know that a label of '+' indicates that the molecule is carcinogenic. So, my task is to count all the atoms that are part of molecules labeled with '+'.   Looking at the database schema, there are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The key tables here are 'atom' and 'molecule' because they contain information about atoms and their respective labels.  The 'atom' table has a column called 'molecule_id', which links each atom to its corresponding molecule. The 'molecule' table has columns 'molecule_id' and 'label'. So, I need to find all the molecules with label '+', then count how many atoms are associated with those molecules.  I'll start by joining the 'atom' and 'molecule' tables on their 'molecule_id' columns. This way, each atom will be matched with its molecule's label. Then, I can add a condition to filter only those molecules where the label is '+'.  To count the number of atoms, I'll use the COUNT() function. Since each row in the 'atom' table represents one atom, counting all such rows that meet the condition will give me the total number of atoms belonging to carcinogenic molecules.  Putting this together, my SQL query should select from the 'atom' table joined with 'molecule', filter by label '+', and count the rows. That should give me the answer. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM atom WHERE molecule_id IN (SELECT molecule_id FROM molecule WHERE label = '+');
SELECT bond.bond_id  FROM bond  JOIN molecule ON bond.molecule_ id = molecule.molecule_ id  WHERE molecule.label = '+' AND bond.bond_ type = '='; 
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM atom  JOIN molecule ON atom.molecule_id = molecule.molecule_id  WHERE atom.element = 'h' AND molecule.label = '+'; 
SELECT b.molecule_id FROM connected c  INNER JOIN bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id  WHERE (c.atom_id = 'TR000_1' OR c.atom_id2 = 'TR000_1') AND c.bond_id = 'TR000_1_2'; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.  The user wants: Among the atoms that contain element carbon, which one does not contain compound carcinogenic?  First, let's break this down. We're looking at atoms with element 'c' (carbon). Then, among these, we need to find those that are in molecules labeled as non-carcinogenic, which is indicated by a label '-'.  So the main steps are: 1. Identify all atoms where the element is 'c'. 2. Check which of these atoms belong to molecules with label '-'. 3. Return the atom_id(s) that meet both conditions.  Looking at the database schema provided:  - The `atom` table has columns: atom_id, molecule_id, element. - The `molecule` table has columns: molecule_id, label.  So I'll need to join these two tables to get the necessary information.   The SQL query should select from `atom`, filter where element is 'c', then join with `molecule` on molecule_id, and further filter where label is '-'.   I think a simple INNER JOIN would work here because we only want atoms that are linked to molecules (so both tables have matching records). Using WHERE clauses after the JOIN will narrow down the results.  Putting it all together:  SELECT atom_id FROM atom JOIN molecule ON atom.molecule_id = molecule.molecule_id WHERE element = 'c' AND label = '-';  I should double-check if there are any possible issues. For example, are there atoms with element 'c' that don't have a corresponding molecule? But since the problem states to consider only those that do (as per the question), an INNER JOIN is appropriate.  Another consideration: The `molecule` table has multiple entries, but we're only interested in those labeled '-'. So the WHERE clause correctly filters this.  I think this should cover all necessary parts of the query. Let me make sure I don't include any extra tables or columns since the question doesn't mention bonds or connections. It's purely about atoms and their molecules. </think>  SELECT atom_id FROM atom JOIN molecule ON atom.molecule_id = molecule.molecule_id WHERE element = 'c' AND label = '-';
SELECT ROUND(     (         COUNT(*) /          (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule)     ) * 100.0, 2 ) AS percentage FROM (     SELECT m.molecule_id     FROM atom a     JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id     WHERE m.label = '+'     GROUP BY m.molecule_id     HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN a.element = 'h' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0 ); 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to determine if molecule TR124 is carcinogenic using SQL based on the provided database schema. Let me start by understanding the problem and the data structures involved.  First, from the extra knowledge given, a label of '+' means the molecule is carcinogenic. So my task is to check what the label is for molecule TR124 and see if it's '+'.  Looking at the database schema, there are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The molecule table has two columns: molecule_id (primary key) and label. Each entry in this table represents a molecule with its ID and whether it's carcinogenic based on the label.  The user's question is asking about TR124 specifically. So I need to query the molecule table where molecule_id equals 'TR124' and check the value of the label column.  I should write an SQL SELECT statement that retrieves the label for TR124. The structure would be something like:  SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id = 'TR124';  This will return the label, which we can then check against '+' to determine if it's carcinogenic. However, since the user only asked for the SQL query and not the interpretation, I just need to provide this SELECT statement.  I should make sure that the syntax is correct. The table name is 'molecule', and the columns are correctly named. Also, TR124 is a string, so it needs single quotes around it in the WHERE clause.  Wait, looking back at the example INSERT statements for molecule, they have values like 'TR000' with three zeros. So TR124 would be another entry, but I don't see any data provided for it. That's okay because the user is asking about a specific molecule whether it exists or not.  So my SQL should handle cases where TR124 might not exist in the database. But since the question is just to write the query, regardless of whether the result exists, that's acceptable.  I think I've got everything covered. The query selects the label from the molecule table where the molecule_id matches 'TR124'. That should give us the necessary information to determine if it's carcinogenic based on the provided knowledge. </think>  SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id = 'TR124';
SELECT atom_id FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR186'; 
<think> Alright, let's tackle this SQL problem step by step. The user is asking for the bond type of "TR007_4_19". First, I need to understand where to find this information in the provided database schema.  Looking at the tables, there's a 'bond' table that includes columns like bond_id and bond_type. This seems directly relevant because the question is about a specific bond ID. The bond_id column likely holds values like "TR007_4_19", which is what we're searching for.  Next, I should consider if other tables are involved. There's an 'atom' table linked via molecule_id and a 'connected' table that ties atoms to bonds. However, since the question is specifically about a bond type, the 'bond' table alone should suffice. The other tables might provide additional context but aren't necessary for this particular query.  I also need to ensure that "TR007_4_19" exists in the bond_id column. From the INSERT statements provided, I notice examples like "TR000_1_2" and "TR001_10_11", which follow a similar pattern. Even though "TR007_4_19" isn't explicitly inserted here, the query should still work if this bond_id exists in the actual database.  Putting it all together, the SQL query should select the bond_type from the 'bond' table where bond_id matches "TR007_4_19". This straightforward approach directly answers the user's question without unnecessary complexity. </think>  SELECT `bond_type` FROM `bond` WHERE `bond_id` = 'TR007_4_19';
<think> Alright, so the user wants me to figure out the SQL query for identifying the elements of atoms connected by bond TR001_2_4. Let's break this down step by step.  First, I need to understand the database schema provided. There are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The atom table has details about each atom, including its element. The bond table contains information about bonds between atoms. The connected table links atoms through their bonds, essentially showing which atoms are connected by which bond.  The user's question is asking for the elements of the atoms involved in bond TR001_2_4. So, my approach should be to find all atoms that are part of this specific bond and then extract their element information.  Looking at the tables, the connected table seems crucial here because it holds pairs of atom IDs along with the bond ID connecting them. So, I'll need to query this table where the bond_id is 'TR001_2_4' to get the atom IDs involved.  Once I have those atom IDs, I can join the connected table with the atom table on the atom_id (both from and to) to retrieve their respective elements. This way, I'll get both atoms participating in that bond along with their elements.  Wait a second—when looking at the sample data provided earlier, there's an INSERT into the connected table for 'TR000_1' and 'TR000_2', but no entry for 'TR001_2_4'. That might mean that either the data isn't present or perhaps it's a typo. However, since the user is asking about TR001_2_4, I'll proceed under the assumption that such a bond exists in their actual database.  So, my SQL query should first identify all atoms connected by 'TR001_2_4' from the connected table. Then, for each atom_id and atom_id2 (since connected stores both ends of the bond), I need to get their element from the atom table.  I think using a JOIN on the atom table twice would be efficient here—once for atom_id and once for atom_id2. This way, I can retrieve the elements in a single query without having to run two separate queries and combine the results manually.  Putting it all together, the SQL should SELECT element and element2 (or perhaps just list them as separate columns) from connected joined with atom on both atom_id and atom_id2 where bond_id is 'TR001_2_4'.  Wait, but in the given sample data, there's no entry for TR001_2_4. So perhaps I should consider that in my answer? Or maybe it's a mistake in the question. However, since the user specifically asked about this bond, I'll proceed as if it exists.  In terms of structure, the query would look something like:  SELECT a.element, b.element  FROM connected c JOIN atom a ON c.atom_id = a.atom_aid JOIN atom b ON c.atom_id2 = b.atom_aid WHERE c.bond_id = 'TR001_2_4';  But I need to make sure the column names are correct. In the atom table, the primary key is atom_id, so in the connected table, it's atom_id and atom_id2.  So, the final query should correctly reference these columns and join them appropriately. </think>  SELECT DISTINCT a.element  FROM connected c  JOIN atom a ON c.atom_id = a.atom_aid  WHERE c.bond_id = 'TR001_2_4';
SELECT COUNT(*) AS double_bond_count  FROM bond  WHERE molecule_id = 'TR006' AND bond_type = '=';  UNION ALL  SELECT label AS carcinogenic_status  FROM molecule  WHERE molecule_id = 'TR006'; 
SELECT m.molecule_id, GROUP_CONCAT(a.element) AS elements  FROM molecule m  JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id  WHERE m.label = '+' AND a.element IS NOT NULL  GROUP BY m.molecule_id; 
SELECT      b.bond_id,     a1.element AS Atom1,     a2.element AS Atom2,     m.label AS MoleculeLabel FROM      bond b JOIN      connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id JOIN      atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id JOIN      atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id LEFT JOIN      molecule m ON b.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE      b.bond_type = '-'; 
SELECT m.molecule_id AS molecule,        GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT a.element) AS elements FROM bond b JOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id JOIN atom a ON a.atom_id = c.atom_id JOIN molecule m ON m.molecule_id = b.molecule_id WHERE b.bond_type = '#' GROUP BY m.molecule_id; 
<think> Okay, so the user is asking me to name the atoms' elements that form bond TR000_2_3. I need to figure out how to extract this information from the provided database schema and data.  First, let me understand the tables involved:  1. **Atom Table**: Contains atom_id, molecule_id, and element. Each row represents an atom with its respective details. 2. **Bond Table**: Includes bond_id, molecule_id, and bond_type. This tells us about each bond in a molecule. 3. **Connected Table**: Links atoms to bonds. It has atom_id, atom_id2, and bond_id, indicating which two atoms are connected by a specific bond.  The goal is to find the elements of both atoms involved in bond TR000_2_3.  So, I need to:  - Identify the two atoms connected by this bond. - Retrieve their respective element information from the atom table.  Let me break down the steps:  1. **Find the Connected Atoms**: Use the 'connected' table where bond_id is 'TR000_2_3'. Each entry here will give me an atom_id and its counterpart (atom_id2). Since each connection is bidirectional, I'll get both atoms involved.  2. **Retrieve Elements for These Atoms**: Once I have the two atom_ids, I can query the 'atom' table to find their elements.  Putting this together in SQL:  - Use a SELECT statement to get elements from the atom table where atom_id matches either of the connected atoms. - Join this with the connected table on bond_id to filter for the specific bond.  Wait, actually, since the connected table directly links to the bond, I can join it with the atom table twice: once for each atom involved (atom_id and atom_id2).  So, my SQL query should:  - Select element from atom where atom_id is in the connected table's atom_id column. - Similarly, select element where atom_id is in the atom_id2 column of the connected table. - Filter by bond_id = 'TR000_2_3'.  This way, I'll get both elements involved in that specific bond.  Let me structure this. Using an OR condition might work, but perhaps a more efficient way is to join twice or use union. However, since each bond connects exactly two atoms, it's simpler to select the element for atom_id and atom_id2 where bond_id matches.  So, the SQL will look like:  SELECT A.element FROM atom A JOIN connected C ON A.atom_id = C.atom_id OR A.atom_id = C.atom_id2 WHERE C.bond_id = 'TR000_2_3';  But wait, this might not be the most efficient, but it should work since each bond is associated with exactly two atoms.  Alternatively, I can write separate SELECT statements and combine them. But for simplicity, using a single query that joins appropriately seems better.  Wait, actually, in the connected table, both atom_id and atom_id2 point to atoms in the same molecule. So, when we look up each atom's element, both will be needed.  So another approach is:  SELECT A.element AS Element1, B.element AS Element2 FROM connected C JOIN atom A ON C.atom_id = A.atom_id JOIN atom B ON C.atom_id2 = B.atom_id WHERE C.bond_id = 'TR000_2_3';  This way, the result will have both elements in separate columns.  But the user just wants the names of the atoms' elements. So perhaps a simple list is sufficient, regardless of order.  Therefore, the query can be written as:  SELECT A.element FROM atom A JOIN connected C ON A.atom_id = C.atom_id AND C.bond_id = 'TR000_2_3' UNION SELECT B.element FROM atom B JOIN connected C ON B.atom_id = C.atom_id2 AND C.bond_id = 'TR000_2_3';  Alternatively, using a single query that covers both cases.  But considering the simplicity, perhaps just selecting from atom where atom_id is in (select atom_id from connected where bond_id='TR000_2_3') OR atom_id is in (select atom_id2 from connected where bond_id='TR000_2_3').  Wait, that might be redundant. Alternatively, using a joined query to get both elements in one go.  But perhaps the simplest way is to select all elements where atom_id exists in either column of the connected table for that specific bond.  So:  SELECT element FROM atom WHERE atom_id IN (     SELECT atom_id FROM connected WHERE bond_id = 'TR000_2_3' ) OR atom_id IN (     SELECT atom_id2 FROM connected WHERE bond_id = 'TR000_2_3' );  But this might be a bit lengthy. Alternatively, using the OR condition in the join.  Alternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to write:  SELECT A.element FROM atom A WHERE A.atom_id IN (     SELECT C.atom_id FROM connected C WHERE C.bond_id = 'TR000_2_3' ) OR A.atom_id IN (     SELECT C.atom_id2 FROM connected C WHERE C.bond_id = 'TR000_2_3' );  This approach uses subqueries to get the atom_ids from both columns and then retrieves their elements.  I think this should cover both atoms involved in the bond. So, the final SQL query would be as above. </think>  SELECT element FROM atom WHERE atom_id IN (SELECT atom_id FROM connected WHERE bond_id = 'TR000_2_3') OR atom_id IN (SELECT atom_id2 FROM connected WHERE bond_id = 'TR000_2_3');
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how many bonds are created by bonding atoms with chlorine. So, let's break this down step by step.  First, I know that chlorine is represented by the element 'cl'. So, I should look for atoms where the element is 'cl'.  Looking at the database schema, there's an `atom` table with columns `atom_id`, `molecule_id`, and `element`. The `bond` table has `bond_id`, `molecule_id`, and `bond_type`. There's also a `connected` table that links atoms through bonds.  Each bond connects two atoms. So, for each bond, I need to check if at least one of the connected atoms is chlorine. If yes, then that bond counts towards our total.  So, my approach would be:  1. Identify all bonds. 2. For each bond, determine if either of the connected atoms has element 'cl'. 3. Count how many such bonds exist.  To achieve this in SQL, I can use a combination of joins and conditions. Let's outline the steps:  - Join `connected` with `atom` on both ends (since each bond connects two atoms). - Check if either atom is chlorine. - Group by `bond_id` to count unique bonds that meet the condition.  I should write a query that selects distinct `bond_id`s from the `connected` table, joining it with the `atom` table for both atoms involved. Then, apply the condition where at least one of the atoms has element 'cl'.  Potential issues I might encounter:  - Ensuring that each bond is only counted once even if multiple chlorine atoms are connected to it. - Using the correct join conditions to link all necessary tables.  To avoid counting duplicates, using `DISTINCT` on `bond_id` should work. Also, ensuring the joins correctly reference both ends of the bonds.  Putting it all together, the SQL query will involve joining the `connected` table with the `atom` table twice—once for each atom involved in the bond. Then, applying the condition on the element and counting distinct bonds. </think>  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.bond_id) FROM connected c JOIN atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id JOIN atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id WHERE a1.element = 'cl' OR a2.element = 'cl';
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's SQL query request based on the provided database schema and data. The user asked for two things: list the atom IDs that belong to the TR346 molecule and determine how many bond types can be created by this molecule.  First, looking at the database schema, there are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule.   The 'atom' table has columns atom_id, molecule_id, and element. Each atom is part of a molecule via molecule_id. The 'molecule' table stores molecule_id and label. Since the user is asking about TR346, I should check if this exists in the molecule table. However, looking at the INSERT statements for the molecule table, I see entries like TR000, TR001, etc., but not TR346. This might be a problem because if TR346 doesn't exist, there are no atoms or bonds associated with it.  Assuming TR346 is a typo and should be one of the existing molecule IDs, perhaps TR000? Or maybe it's a new molecule that wasn't inserted in the provided data. But since the user specifically mentioned TR346, I'll proceed as if it exists or handle the case where it might not.  For the first part, listing atom IDs for TR346: I need to select atom_id from the atom table where molecule_id is 'TR346'. The SQL would be something like SELECT atom_id FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR346';.  For the second part, counting bond types created by this molecule. Bond types are stored in the bond table under bond_type. I need to count distinct bond_type entries where molecule_id is 'TR346'. So, the SQL would be SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT bond_type) FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR346';.  Putting it all together, the user might want these two queries as separate outputs or combined into one result. However, since they asked for two specific pieces of information, providing each query separately makes sense.  I also need to ensure that the SQL syntax is correct and matches the database schema. The atom table references molecule_id, which should be a valid foreign key. Similarly, bond uses molecule_id correctly.  Another consideration: if TR346 doesn't exist in the molecule table, both queries will return nothing or zero counts. So, it's essential to verify that TR346 is present before running these queries. But since I don't have control over the data, I'll proceed as per the user's request.  In conclusion, I'll write two SQL queries: one selecting atom_ids and another counting distinct bond types for the specified molecule ID. </think>  SELECT `atom_id` FROM `atom` WHERE `molecule_id` = 'TR346';   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `bond_type`) FROM `bond` WHERE `molecule_id` = 'TR346';
WITH double_bond_molecules AS (     SELECT DISTINCT molecule_id      FROM bond      WHERE bond_type = '=' ) SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM molecule  WHERE label = '+' AND molecule_id IN (SELECT molecule_id FROM double_bond_molecules); 
SELECT COUNT(molecule.molecule_id) FROM molecule  WHERE NOT EXISTS (     SELECT 1 FROM atom WHERE atom.molecule_id = molecule.molecule_id AND element = 's' )  AND NOT EXISTS (     SELECT 1 FROM bond WHERE bond.molecule_id = molecule.molecule_id AND bond_type = '=' ); 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "What is the carcinogenic label for bond TR001_2_4?"   First, let me understand what each part of the question means. The term "carcinogenic label" refers to whether a molecule is considered carcinogenic. From the user's extra knowledge, I know that if the label is '+', then the molecule is carcinogenic.  So, the goal here is to find out the label associated with the specific bond, TR001_2_4.  Looking at the database schema provided:  - There's a `bond` table which contains information about each bond, including its ID and the molecule it belongs to. - The `molecule` table has details about each molecule, specifically the `molecule_id` and its `label`.  The `bond` table has a column called `molecule_id`, which is a foreign key linking to the `molecule` table. This means that each bond record is associated with one specific molecule.  Given this structure, I can determine the label by first finding out which molecule the bond TR001_2_4 belongs to and then checking the label of that molecule.  So, the steps are:  1. Query the `bond` table to find the `molecule_id` for the bond with ID 'TR001_2_4'. 2. Use that `molecule_id` to query the `molecule` table and retrieve the corresponding `label`.  Putting this into SQL, I can write a subquery or use a join. However, since we're only looking for one specific bond, a subquery might be more straightforward.  The SQL query would select the `label` from the `molecule` table where the `molecule_id` matches the `molecule_id` of the specified bond in the `bond` table.  So, putting it all together, the query would look something like this:  SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id = (SELECT molecule_id FROM bond WHERE bond_id = 'TR001_2_4');  This way, we first find the `molecule_id` for the given bond and then get its label to determine if it's carcinogenic.  I should ensure that I'm using the correct table names and column names as per the schema. Also, the bond ID is a string, so it needs to be enclosed in single quotes.  Another consideration: What if there are multiple bonds with the same `molecule_id`? However, since each bond's record includes its own `molecule_id`, querying by `bond_id` will uniquely identify the molecule associated with that specific bond.  I don't think I need any joins here because a subquery directly references the necessary data without complicating the structure. Additionally, using a subquery keeps the query concise and easy to understand.  Finally, since the user only wants the SQL statement without comments, I'll make sure to present it cleanly. </think>  SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id = (SELECT molecule_id FROM bond WHERE bond_id = 'TR001_2_4');
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR001'; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '-'; 
<think> Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to answer this SQL query based on the user's question. Let me break it down step by step.  First, the user is asking: Among the molecules which contain "cl" element, which of them are carcinogenic? They also provided some extra knowledge that label '+' means the molecule is carcinogenic. So, I need to find all molecules with 'cl' elements and then check if their label is '+'.  Looking at the database schema, there are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The key tables here are atom and molecule because they contain the necessary information about elements and labels respectively.  The atom table has columns atom_id, molecule_id, and element. Each entry represents an atom in a molecule. So, to find molecules containing 'cl', I need to look for rows where element is 'cl' and then get their molecule_ids.  Once I have those molecule_ids, I need to check the molecule table which has molecule_id and label. The label indicates if it's carcinogenic. So, I'll join the atom table with the molecule table on molecule_id to filter out only those molecules with label '+'.  I should use a SELECT statement to get the molecule_id from the molecule table where the label is '+'. But first, I need to ensure that these molecules are linked to atoms with 'cl' elements. That means joining the molecule and atom tables on molecule_id.  Wait, but how do I structure this? Maybe using a WHERE clause with an IN operator. The IN operator can check if the molecule_id exists in a subquery that selects all molecule_ids from the atom table where element is 'cl'.  Putting it together, the SQL query should select distinct molecule_id from molecule where label is '+' and molecule_id is present in the list of molecule_ids from the atom table where element is 'cl'.  I need to make sure I'm selecting distinct molecule_ids because a single molecule might have multiple 'cl' atoms. Also, using a subquery ensures that only the relevant molecules are considered.  Let me draft this out:  SELECT DISTINCT m.molecule_id FROM molecule m WHERE m.label = '+' AND m.molecule_id IN (     SELECT a.molecule_id     FROM atom a     WHERE a.element = 'cl' );  This should fetch all unique molecule IDs that have the label '+' and contain at least one 'cl' element. That answers the user's question accurately.  I think this covers everything needed. The subquery gets all molecules with 'cl', then we filter those to only include carcinogenic ones based on their label. </think>  SELECT DISTINCT m.molecule_id FROM molecule m WHERE m.label = '+' AND m.molecule_id IN (SELECT a.molecule_id FROM atom a WHERE a.element = 'cl');
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me try to break this down step by step.  First, the user is asking: Among the molecules which contain "c" element, which of them are not carcinogenic? They also provided some extra knowledge that label = '-' means non-carcinogenic.  Looking at the database schema, there are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule.   The atom table has atom_id, molecule_id, and element columns. So, to find molecules containing "c", I need to look into this table where element is 'c'.  Each molecule is represented in the molecule table with molecule_id as the primary key and a label indicating if it's non-carcinogenic.  So, my approach should be:  1. Find all molecules that have at least one atom with element 'c'. 2. From those molecules, select only those where the label is '-'.  I think I'll need to use two main tables: atom and molecule. But since each molecule can have multiple atoms, I might need to join these tables appropriately and then filter based on the conditions.  Let me outline the steps:  - Select distinct molecule_id from the atom table where element = 'c'. - Then, join this result with the molecule table to get their labels. - Finally, filter the results to include only those molecules where label is '-'.  I should also ensure that I'm not getting duplicate entries for the same molecule. Using DISTINCT in the first part will help with that.  Putting it all together, the SQL query would involve a SELECT statement from both tables, using an INNER JOIN on molecule_id. The WHERE clauses will handle the element check and the label filter.  I think it's important to make sure that all parts are correctly joined and that I'm not missing any necessary conditions. Also, since some molecules might have multiple atoms with 'c', but we just need at least one to include them, using EXISTS or a JOIN should work.  Maybe I can write it as:  SELECT m.molecule_id  FROM molecule m WHERE m.label = '-' AND EXISTS (     SELECT 1      FROM atom a      WHERE a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id      AND a.element = 'c' );  Alternatively, using a JOIN might be more efficient. Let me think about that.  Another way is to join the atom and molecule tables directly:  SELECT DISTINCT a.molecule_id FROM atom a JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE a.element = 'c' AND m.label = '-';  Yes, this should also work because it's selecting all unique molecule_ids where there's at least one 'c' element and the label is '-'.  I think either approach would be correct. But using DISTINCT ensures that each molecule appears only once even if it has multiple 'c' atoms. </think>  SELECT m.molecule_id FROM atom a JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE a.element = 'c' AND m.label = '-';
SELECT      (SUM(CASE WHEN EXISTS (         SELECT 1 FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = m.molecule_id AND element = 'cl'     ) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS percentage FROM molecule m WHERE m.label = '+'; 
<think> Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the SQL query for the user's question.  First, the user asked: "What is the molecule id of bond id TR001_1_7?" My goal is to find the corresponding molecule_id from the bond table based on the given bond_id.  Looking at the database schema provided:  - The `bond` table has columns: bond_id, molecule_id, and bond_type. - Each row in this table represents a bond and includes its unique identifier (bond_id), the molecule it belongs to (molecule_id), and the type of bond.  So, the task is straightforward: retrieve the molecule_id where the bond_id is 'TR001_1_7'.  I considered whether there are any other tables involved that might affect this query. For example, checking if the `connected` or `atom` tables relate to bonds, but since the question directly asks about a bond's molecule ID, it's most efficient to query the `bond` table directly.  Another point I thought about was whether the bond_id 'TR001_1_7' exists in the provided data. The examples include bond_ids like 'TR000_1_2' and 'TR001_10_11', but not 'TR001_1_7'. However, since the user is asking about this specific ID, I assumed it either exists or they expect the query to handle cases where it might not be present. The SQL uses a WHERE clause with the exact value, which will return the molecule_id if it exists or no results otherwise.  I also considered if any joins were necessary, but since all required information is in the `bond` table, there's no need for additional joins. This keeps the query simple and efficient.  In summary, by directly accessing the `molecule_id` from the `bond` table where `bond_id` matches 'TR001_1_7', I can provide an accurate and efficient SQL solution. </think>  SELECT molecule_id FROM bond WHERE bond_id = 'TR001_1_7';
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT element)  FROM atom  WHERE atom_id IN (     SELECT atom_id FROM connected WHERE bond_id = 'TR001_3_4'     UNION     SELECT atom_id2 FROM connected WHERE bond_id = 'TR001_3_4' ); 
SELECT b.bond_type  FROM connected c  JOIN bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id  WHERE (c.atom_id = 'TR000_1' AND c.atom_id2 = 'TR000_2')     OR (c.atom_id = 'TR000_2' AND c.atom_id2 = 'TR000_1'); 
SELECT * FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id IN (SELECT molecule_id FROM atom WHERE atom_id = 'TR000_2') AND molecule_id IN (SELECT molecule_id FROM atom WHERE atom_id = 'TR000_4'); 
SELECT element FROM atom WHERE atom_id = 'TR000_1'; 
SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id = 'TR000'; 
SELECT      (SUM(CASE WHEN bond_type = '-' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(bond_id)) * 100 AS percentage FROM      connected; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.  The question is: "How many carcinogenic molecules that consisted of Nitrogen?" So, I need to find the count of molecules that are both carcinogenic and contain nitrogen atoms.  From the extra knowledge provided: - Nitrogen refers to elements where element = 'n'. - A label of '+' means the molecule is carcinogenic.  Looking at the database schema, there are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The key tables here will be the atom table (to check for nitrogen) and the molecule table (to check if it's carcinogenic).  So, I need to find all molecules where: 1. Their label is '+', indicating they're carcinogenic. 2. They have at least one atom with element 'n'.  The approach would be to join the molecule table with the atom table, filter by the conditions above, and then count the distinct molecules.  Let me outline the steps: 1. Select the molecule_id from the atom table where element is 'n'. 2. Join this result with the molecule table on molecule_id. 3. Filter in the molecule table for those with label '+'. 4. Count the number of such molecules, making sure to count each molecule only once even if it has multiple nitrogen atoms.  So, I'll write a query that selects from atom where element is 'n', then joins with molecule where the label is '+'. Using DISTINCT ensures we don't double-count any molecule.  Putting it together, the SQL should be something like: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) FROM molecule m JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id WHERE a.element = 'n' AND m.label = '+';  I think that covers everything. I'll double-check to make sure I'm joining correctly and applying the right conditions. </think>  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `molecule`.`molecule_id`) FROM `molecule` JOIN `atom` ON `molecule`.`molecule_id` = `atom`.`molecule_id` WHERE `atom`.`element` = 'n' AND `molecule`.`label` = '+';
SELECT a.molecule_id  FROM atom a  JOIN connected c ON a.atom_id = c.atom_id  JOIN bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id  WHERE a.element = 's' AND b.bond_type = '='; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question: "Which non-carcinogenic molecules consisted of more than 5 atoms?" Let me break this down step by step.  First, understanding the database schema is crucial. There are four tables involved: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The key relationships here are between the molecule table and the others. Each molecule can have multiple atoms and bonds, which are linked through their IDs.  The user provided some extra knowledge that's essential: 1. A molecule with a label of '-' is non-carcinogenic. 2. "Consisted more than 5 atoms" translates to counting the number of atoms per molecule where this count exceeds 5.  So, my goal is to find all molecules labeled '-', which have more than 5 atoms associated with them.  Looking at the tables: - The molecule table has columns: molecule_id and label. - The atom table includes atom_id, molecule_id, and element. Each row in atom represents an atom in a specific molecule (since they share the same molecule_id).    Therefore, to count the number of atoms per molecule, I can group the atom table by molecule_id and count how many times each molecule_id appears.  The steps I need to take: 1. Count the number of atoms for each molecule using the atom table. 2. Filter these counts to include only those with more than 5 atoms. 3. Join this result with the molecule table to check the label condition (label = '-').  Let me structure this into SQL queries:  First, I'll create a subquery to count the atoms per molecule: SELECT molecule_id, COUNT(*) as atom_count FROM atom GROUP BY molecule_id HAVING atom_count > 5;  This gives me all molecules with more than 5 atoms. Now, I need to join this result with the molecule table to filter out only non-carcinogenic ones (label = '-').  Putting it together: SELECT m.molecule_id  FROM molecule m JOIN (     SELECT molecule_id, COUNT(*) as atom_count      FROM atom      GROUP BY molecule_id      HAVING atom_count > 5 ) a_count ON m.molecule_id = a_count.molecule_id  WHERE m.label = '-';  This should give me the list of non-carcinogenic molecules with more than 5 atoms.  I need to make sure that the join correctly associates each molecule's ID from both tables and that the WHERE clause correctly filters for non-carcinogenic labels. Also, the HAVING clause ensures we only consider those with counts over 5.  Testing this query against the provided data:  Looking at the inserts: - Molecule TR000 has several atoms (TR000_1 to TR000_5), which is 5 atoms. Since the condition is more than 5, it won't be included. - Other molecules like TR001, TR002 might have varying numbers of atoms, but without their atom entries, we can't be sure.  Wait a minute, in the example data provided for the atom table: TR000 has 5 atoms (TR000_1 to TR000_5). So, according to our query, it's exactly 5. Since the condition is COUNT >5, it would not include TR000.  But perhaps there are other molecules with more than 5 atoms that I'm not seeing in the sample data provided. The user didn't specify if there are any such molecules beyond what's shown, but the query should still function correctly regardless of the current data.  I think this approach covers all necessary conditions: it counts the atoms per molecule, filters for those over 5, and then checks their labels to ensure they're non-carcinogenic. The use of a subquery allows me to handle the atom count efficiently before joining with the main molecule table. </think>  SELECT m.molecule_id  FROM molecule m JOIN (     SELECT molecule_id, COUNT(*) as atom_count      FROM atom      GROUP BY molecule_id      HAVING atom_count > 5 ) a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id  WHERE m.label = '-';
<think> Alright, let's tackle this SQL problem step by step. The user is asking to list all the elements that have a double bond in molecule TR024.   First, I need to understand what each part of the question means. A "double bond" refers to a bond where `bond_type` is '=' according to the extra knowledge provided. So, my query needs to filter bonds with this type.  Next, the elements involved are found in the `atom` table under the `element` column. Each element corresponds to a specific symbol as given, like 'cl' for Chlorine.  The molecule in question is TR024. However, looking at the provided data, there isn't an entry for TR024 in the `molecule` table. The closest entries are TR000, TR001, etc., but no TR024. This might be a typo or perhaps not included in the sample data. For the sake of this exercise, I'll proceed as if TR024 exists.  Now, mapping out the relationships:  1. **Bond Table**: Contains information about each bond, including its type and which molecule it belongs to. 2. **Connected Table**: Links atoms through bonds. Each entry shows two atoms connected by a specific bond. 3. **Atom Table**: Provides details about each atom, including its element and the molecule it's part of.  To list elements with double bonds in TR024, I need to join these tables appropriately.  - Start with the `bond` table where `molecule_id` is 'TR024' and `bond_type` is '='. - Use the `connected` table to link each bond to its atoms. - Then, connect to the `atom` table via `atom_1` in `connected` to get the elements.  I should ensure that I select distinct elements to avoid duplicates because one bond can connect two atoms of the same element, leading to duplicate entries otherwise.  Putting it all together:  - Select `element` from `atom`. - Join with `connected` on `atom_id`. - Then join with `bond` where `molecule_id` is 'TR024' and `bond_type` is '='. - Use LEFT JOIN in case there are multiple connections, but since we're selecting distinct elements, it should handle duplicates.  Wait a moment—since each bond in the connected table has an atom_1 and atom_2, both could be part of the same element. So, to cover all possibilities, perhaps I should also check both `atom_id` and `atom_id2` in the connected table? But looking at the data, each connected entry already represents a bidirectional link between two atoms via a bond. Therefore, including both might not be necessary because each atom is already linked through the same bond.  Alternatively, to ensure we capture all atoms involved in double bonds, maybe I should union the results from `atom_id` and `atom_id2`. However, since the connected table lists both directions (e.g., TR000_1 to TR000_2 and vice versa), each atom appears twice. But when selecting elements, using DISTINCT will take care of duplicates.  Wait, but in the sample data, for molecule TR000, the bonds are single, so no double bonds there. The only double bond in the provided data is TR001_10_11 with type '='. So, if I were to run this query on the given data, it would return elements from TR001 where a double bond exists.  But since the user specified TR024, which isn't present here, maybe they intended TR001 or another molecule ID. Regardless, structuring the query correctly is key.  So, final steps:  - Use SELECT DISTINCT to get unique elements. - Join `atom` with `connected` on atom_id and then join with `bond` where bond_type is '=' and molecule_id is 'TR024'. </think>  SELECT DISTINCT a.element FROM atom a JOIN connected c ON a.atom_id = c.atom_id JOIN bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id WHERE b.molecule_id = 'TR024' AND b.bond_type = '=';
   SELECT m.molecule_id, COUNT(a.atom_id) as atom_count    FROM molecule m    LEFT JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id    WHERE m.label = '+'    GROUP BY m.molecule_id    
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to calculate the percentage of carcinogenic molecules that have triple bonded hydrogen atoms based on the provided database schema and data.  First, let's break down the requirements:  1. **Carcinogenic Molecules**: These are identified by the label '+' in the molecule table. 2. **Triple Bonded Hydrogen Atoms**: This means we're looking for bonds where bond_type is '#', and the element connected is 'h'.  I need to find all molecules that meet both criteria and then calculate what percentage they represent of all relevant cases.  Looking at the tables:  - **atom** table has information about each atom, including its element. - **bond** table holds details about bonds, including their type. - **connected** table links atoms with bonds, showing which atoms are connected by which bond.  The approach should be to join these tables appropriately to get the necessary data.  Steps:  1. **Identify Molecules with Triple Bonds and Hydrogen Atoms**:     - Join atom, bond, and connected tables to find hydrogen atoms that are part of triple bonds.     2. **Filter for Carcinogenic Molecules**:    - Ensure that these molecules have a label of '+' in the molecule table.  3. **Calculate the Percentage**:    - Count how many such molecules exist and divide by the total number of molecules with relevant conditions (those having hydrogen atoms and triple bonds), then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.  Potential Issues:  - Ensuring that both ends of the bond are considered, which might require checking both atom_id and atom_id2 in the connected table. - Making sure not to double-count any molecule if it has multiple qualifying hydrogen atoms.  After considering these points, I'll structure the SQL query accordingly:  - Use LEFT JOINs to ensure all relevant data is included without missing out on necessary rows. - Apply WHERE clauses to filter for label '+', bond type '#', and element 'h'. - Group by molecule_id to count each molecule once even if it has multiple qualifying atoms.  Finally, use COUNT DISTINCT to avoid overcounting molecules with multiple qualifying entries. </think>  SELECT      (COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) /       (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m2.molecule_id)        FROM molecule m2        WHERE m2.label = '+')) * 100.0 AS percentage FROM      molecule m JOIN      atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id AND a.element = 'h' JOIN      bond b ON m.molecule_id = b.molecule_id AND b.bond_type = '#' WHERE      m.label = '+';

<think> Okay, so the user is asking for an SQL query to find the element with a specific atom ID in a molecule that's not carcinogenic. Let me break this down.  First, I need to understand the database schema they provided. There are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The atom table has atom_id, molecule_id, and element. Molecule has molecule_id and label. The label determines if a molecule is carcinogenic or not; '-' means non-carcinogenic.  The user's question specifically asks for the element of the atom with ID 'TR004_7' in a molecule that isn't carcinogenic. So I need to join the atom table with the molecule table on molecule_id. Then, filter where the label is '-'.   Wait, but looking at the data provided, there's no atom with atom_id 'TR004_7' inserted into the atom table. The example data only goes up to TR000_5. But maybe that's just sample data, and in their actual database, such an atom exists.  So I'll proceed under the assumption that the atom does exist. In my SQL query, I'll select the element from the atom table where atom_id is 'TR004_7'. Then, join with molecule on molecule_id, adding a condition that label must be '-' to ensure it's non-carcinogenic.  I should also make sure that only one row is returned since each atom_id is unique. The LIMIT 1 isn't strictly necessary but ensures we get just the element without duplicates.  Putting it all together: SELECT element FROM atom JOIN molecule ON atom.molecule_id = molecule.molecule_id WHERE atom.atom_id = 'TR004_7' AND molecule.label = '-';   I think that's everything. The query should fetch the required element correctly. </think>  SELECT element FROM atom JOIN molecule ON atom.molecule_id = molecule.molecule_id WHERE atom_id = 'TR004_7' AND label = '-';
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.molecule_id) AS total_molecules FROM connected c JOIN bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id JOIN atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id LEFT JOIN atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id WHERE b.bond_type = '=' AND (a1.element = 'o' OR a2.element = 'o'); 
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM molecule  WHERE label = '-'  AND molecule_id IN (     SELECT DISTINCT molecule_id      FROM bond      WHERE bond_type = '#' ); 
SELECT element FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR002' UNION ALL SELECT bond_type FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR002'; 
<think> Alright, let's tackle this SQL problem step by step. The user is asking for the atom ID of a double-bonded carbon in the TR012 molecule.   First, I need to understand the database schema provided. There are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. Each has specific columns that relate to each other through foreign keys.  The question mentions "double bonded carbon." From the extra knowledge given, carbon is where element = 'c', and a double bond is where bond_type = '='. So, I need to find atoms that are elements of 'c' and are connected by bonds with type '=' in the TR012 molecule.  Looking at the tables: - The atom table has atom_id, molecule_id, and element. - The bond table has bond_id, molecule_id, and bond_type. - The connected table links two atom_ids via a bond_id.  Since the user is asking about the TR012 molecule, I should check if this molecule exists in the provided data. However, looking at the INSERT statements for the molecule table, there's no entry for 'TR012'. This might be an oversight, but perhaps it's a typo or intended as a test. For the sake of solving the problem, I'll proceed assuming that TR012 is a valid molecule in the database.  Next, to find the double-bonded carbon: 1. Start with the atom table where element = 'c' and molecule_id = 'TR012'. 2. Then, look into the connected table to see which atoms are bonded via a bond of type '='. 3. Join these tables appropriately to get the required atom_id.  I need to ensure that each part of the query correctly references the necessary columns: - Select atom_id from the atom table where element is 'c'. - Use JOIN on the connected table to link the atom's id with bond details. - Ensure that the molecule_id in all relevant tables matches 'TR012'. - Finally, filter by bond_type = '=' in the bond table.  I should also consider how to handle cases where multiple atoms might meet this condition. The query should return all such atom_ids if there are multiple double-bonded carbons in TR012.  Putting it all together, I'll write a SELECT statement that joins the atom and connected tables, filters by element 'c' and bond_type '=', and ensures molecule_id is 'TR012'. This should give me the correct atom ID(s). </think>  SELECT `atom`.`atom_id` FROM `atom` JOIN `connected` ON `atom`.`atom_id` = `connected`.`atom_1` WHERE `atom`.`element` = 'c' AND `connected`.`bond_id` IN (SELECT `bond`.`bond_id` FROM `bond` WHERE `bond`.`molecule_id` = 'TR012' AND `bond`.`bond_type` = '=');
SELECT atom_id FROM atom WHERE molecule_id IN (SELECT molecule_id FROM molecule WHERE label = '+') AND element = 'o'; 
SELECT * FROM cards WHERE cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL; 
SELECT * FROM cards WHERE borderColor IS NOT NULL AND (cardKingdomFoilId IS NULL OR cardKingdomId IS NULL); 
SELECT name FROM cards WHERE faceConvertedManaCost > convertedManaCost AND faceConvertedManaCost IS NOT NULL; 
SELECT name FROM cards WHERE frameVersion = '2015' AND edhrec_rank < 100; 
SELECT c.*  FROM cards c  JOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid  WHERE l.format = 'gladiator' AND l.status = 'Banned' AND c.rarity = 'mythic'; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me break down what they're asking for.  First, the user wants information about artifact type cards that don't have multiple faces on the same card. They specifically want their legal status for the vintage play format.   Alright, so from the database schema provided, I see there are several tables: cards, legalities, sets, etc. The main table here is 'cards' which contains details about each card, including its type and whether it has multiple faces.  I remember that in the cards table, the 'type' field holds information about what kind of card it is. So for artifacts, I need to filter where type equals 'Artifact'. Then, the user mentioned that the card shouldn't have multiple faces on the same card. In the database, this is indicated by the 'side' column being NULL because if a card has multiple faces, there's probably an entry in the side field.  Next, looking at legalities, the statuses are stored in the legalities table. Each record there has a format and its corresponding status for a card. The user wants to know about the vintage format, so I need to filter where the format is 'vintage'.  Putting it all together, I'll use a JOIN between the cards and legalities tables on the uuid field since that's the common identifier. Then, apply the filters: type is 'Artifact', side is NULL, and format is 'vintage'. Finally, select the uuid and status from the legalities table to show which artifact cards are legal in vintage.  I should make sure to use the correct join syntax and alias the tables for clarity, maybe using c for cards and l for legalities. That way, the query remains readable. Also, ensure that all conditions are correctly placed in the WHERE clause. </think>  SELECT l.uuid, l.status FROM legalities l JOIN cards c ON l.uuid = c.uuid WHERE c.type = 'Artifact' AND c.side IS NULL AND l.format = 'vintage';
SELECT c.id AS card_id, c.artist  FROM cards c JOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid WHERE (c.power = '*' OR c.power IS NULL) AND l.format = 'commander' AND l.status = 'Legal'; 
SELECT      c.card_id,     c.name,     r.text AS ruling_text,     CASE WHEN c.hasContentWarning = 1 THEN 'Missing or degraded properties' ELSE 'Properties are intact' END AS property_status FROM      cards c JOIN      rulings r ON c.uuid = r.uuid WHERE      c.artist = 'Stephen Daniel'; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that describes the information about rulings for a card named 'Sublime Epiphany' with number '74s'. Let me break this down step by step.  First, I know that the user is looking for rulings related to a specific card. The card's name is given as 'Sublime Epiphany', and its number is '74s'. So, my SQL query needs to retrieve data from the 'rulings' table where these conditions are met.  Looking at the database structure provided, there's a 'cards' table which contains information about each card. This table includes columns like 'name' and 'number'. The 'rulings' table has a foreign key 'uuid' that references the 'uuid' in the 'cards' table. So, to get the rulings for a specific card, I need to join the 'rulings' table with the 'cards' table on the 'uuid' field.  So, the plan is: 1. Select the ruling text from the 'rulings' table. 2. Join this table with the 'cards' table using the 'uuid'. 3. Apply the conditions where the card's name is 'Sublime Epiphany' and its number is '74s'.  I should structure the SQL query using an INNER JOIN to ensure that only matching records are returned. The WHERE clause will filter for the specific card name and number.  Let me consider the exact column names. In the 'cards' table, there's a 'name' column and a 'number' column. So I'll use 'cards.name = 'Sublime Epiphany'' and 'cards.number = '74s''.   Putting it all together, the query should select 'rulings.text' where the join conditions are met and the specific card details match.  I think that's it. Now, let me write this as an SQL statement without any comments. </think>  SELECT rulings.text FROM rulings INNER JOIN cards ON rulings.uuid = cards.uuid WHERE cards.name = 'Sublime Epiphany' AND cards.number = '74s';
SELECT c.name AS card_name, c.artist, COUNT(r.id) AS ruling_count, c.isPromo FROM cards c JOIN rulings r ON c.uuid = r.uuid GROUP BY c.uuid, c.name, c.artist ORDER BY ruling_count DESC LIMIT 1;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT type) FROM cards WHERE artist = 'Aaron Boyd'; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to answer the SQL query for finding the keyword on the card named 'Angel of Mercy'. Let me start by understanding the database structure based on the provided schema.  First, looking at the tables: there's a `cards` table which likely contains information about each card, including its name and possibly keywords. Then there are other tables like `legalities`, `sets`, etc., but for this question, I think only the `cards` table is relevant.  I see that the user mentioned 'Angel of Mercy' is the name of a card. So, I should query the `cards` table where the name column matches this string. The goal is to retrieve the keyword associated with this specific card.  Assuming the `keywords` field in the `cards` table stores the keywords for each card. So, the SQL would select the `keywords` column from `cards` where the `name` equals 'Angel of Mercy'.  I should ensure that the query uses exact matching to avoid any partial matches. Also, since the user provided an example response with double quotes around the string, I'll follow that format in my own thinking.  So, putting it all together, the SQL statement would be straightforward: select keywords from cards where name is 'Angel of Mercy'. </think>  SELECT keywords FROM cards WHERE name = "Angel of Mercy";
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE power = '*'; 
SELECT promoTypes FROM cards WHERE name = 'Duress'; 
SELECT borderColor FROM cards WHERE name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'; 
<think> Alright, let's tackle this SQL problem step by step. The user wants to find out the original type of the card "Ancestor's Chosen." From their note, I understand that "original type" refers to the `originalType` column in the cards table.  First, I need to identify the correct table and column where this information is stored. The cards table seems appropriate since it contains various details about each card, including its original type.  Next, I should construct a SELECT statement to retrieve the `originalType` value. The WHERE clause will filter the results for the specific card name: "Ancestor's Chosen." Using the `name` column in the cards table makes sense here.  I also need to ensure that the SQL syntax is correct. Properly escaping the string with quotes and using an alias like `type` for clarity might be helpful, especially if someone else reads the query later.  Additionally, I should consider case sensitivity. If the database isn't case-insensitive, "Ancestor's Chosen" must match exactly as it appears in the table. But since the problem doesn't mention this, I'll proceed with the exact name provided.  Putting it all together, the SQL statement fetches the original type from the cards table where the card's name is "Ancestor's Chosen." This should give the user the desired information directly. </think>  SELECT originalType AS type FROM cards WHERE name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen';

<think> Alright, let's break down how I would approach solving this SQL problem step by step.  First, I need to understand the question clearly: "Indicates the name of all the languages into which the set whose number of cards is 309 is translated." From the extra knowledge provided, I know that "number of cards" refers to the baseSetSize, and we're looking for a set where this value is 309.  Looking at the database schema, there are several tables involved. The main tables here are `sets` and `set_translations`. The `sets` table contains information about each set, including its code and baseSetSize. The `set_translations` table provides translations of set names into different languages, linking back to the sets via the setCode.  So, my goal is to find all entries in `set_Translations` where the corresponding set has a baseSetSize of 309. To do this, I'll need to join these two tables on the setCode.  Here's how I'd structure the query:  1. **SELECT Clause**: I want the languages and their translations. So, I'll select `language` and `translation` from `set_Translations`. 2. **JOIN Condition**: I'll join `sets` with `set_Translations` using the setCode as the common key. 3. **WHERE Clause**: Filter the sets where baseSetSize equals 309.  I should ensure that I use aliases for clarity, like 'st' for `set_Translations` and 's' for `sets`, making the query easier to read.  Potential pitfalls include ensuring correct table joins and using the right column names. Since setCode is in both tables but with different references (code in sets), I need to correctly link them.  Testing this, if there's a set with baseSetSize 309, say '10E', the query should return all translations for that set from `set_Translations` where setCode is '10E'. From the sample data provided, this would include entries in Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, French, German, and Italian.  So, putting it all together, I'll write a SELECT statement joining the two tables with the appropriate WHERE condition to filter by baseSetSize. </think>  SELECT st.language, st.translation FROM set_Translations st JOIN sets s ON st.setCode = s.code WHERE s.baseSetSize = 309;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT st.id) AS brazilian_portuguese_commander_sets  FROM set_translations st  JOIN sets s ON st.setCode = s.code  WHERE s.block = 'Commander' AND st.language = 'Portuguese (Brasil)'; 
SELECT c.id FROM cards c  JOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid  WHERE c.types LIKE '%Creature%' AND l.status = 'Legal'  GROUP BY c.id;

<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "How many cards with print rarity have ruling text printed on 01/02/2007?"   First, let's break down the question. The user is asking for the count of cards that meet two specific conditions: 1. The card has a print rarity of 'rare'. 2. There exists at least one ruling associated with this card that was printed on January 2, 2007.  Looking at the database schema provided, I see there are several tables involved:  - **cards**: This table contains information about each card, including its rarity. - **rulings**: This table holds rulings for cards, with a date and text. Each ruling is linked to a card via the uuid column.    So, my goal is to count the number of cards in the 'cards' table where: - The rarity is 'rare'. - There exists at least one entry in the 'rulings' table with a date of '2007-02-01' (which corresponds to 01/02/2007) and the same uuid as the card.  I'll need to join the 'cards' and 'rulings' tables on the uuid column. Then, I can filter based on the rarity and the ruling date. Finally, I'll count the distinct cards that meet these conditions to avoid duplicates if a card has multiple rulings on that date.  Let me structure this step by step:  1. **SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.uuid)**: This ensures we count each unique card once, even if it has multiple rulings on the specified date. 2. **FROM cards c**: We're selecting from the 'cards' table, aliased as 'c'. 3. **JOIN rulings r ON c.uuid = r.uuid**: This links each card to its rulings. 4. **WHERE c.rarity = 'rare' AND r.date = '2007-02-01'**: Filters for cards that are rare and have a ruling on the given date.  I should make sure that the date format is correct in the SQL query, using 'YYYY-MM-DD' as specified. Also, I need to ensure that only cards with both conditions are counted.  Putting it all together, the SQL query should look like this:  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.uuid) FROM cards c JOIN rulings r ON c.uuid = r.uuid WHERE c.rarity = 'rare' AND r.date = '2007-02-01';  I think that's the correct approach. It joins the necessary tables, applies the filters for rarity and date, and counts distinct uuids to get the number of unique cards meeting both conditions. </think>  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.uuid) FROM cards c JOIN rulings r ON c.uuid = r.uuid WHERE c.rarity = 'rare' AND r.date = '2007-02-01';

<think> Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to write an SQL query that lists the set name for the set code "ALL". Let me go through this step by step.  First, I look at the database schema provided. There are several tables mentioned: cards, legalities, sets, set_translations, and rulings. But for this specific question, I'm only concerned with finding the set name corresponding to a particular set code.   The user is asking about set code "ALL", so I need to find which table contains set codes. Looking at the tables, the 'sets' table has a column called 'code', which seems to be the set code. So that's where I should look.  In the 'sets' table, there are columns like id, baseSetSize, block, booster, code, and others. The 'code' column is marked as NOT NULL, so every set must have a code. Therefore, if there's a set with code "ALL", it will be in this table.  Next, I need to select the name of the set where the code is "ALL". So my query should SELECT the 'name' FROM the 'sets' table WHERE the 'code' equals 'ALL'.  Wait a second, but looking at the sample data provided for other tables like set_translations, I see that they have translations for different languages. However, for this question, we're only asked about the set name in general, not specific to any language. So I don't need to consider the translations unless the 'sets' table's 'name' column isn't sufficient.  But since the 'sets' table has a 'name' column, that should be the primary source. The set_translations are probably for localized names, but the question doesn't specify needing a translated name; it just asks for the set name of code "ALL". So relying on the 'name' in the 'sets' table is appropriate.  I should check if there's an entry for code "ALL" in the 'sets' table. The provided examples don't include that, but the query will return nothing if it doesn't exist, which is acceptable.  So putting this together, the SQL statement would be straightforward: select name from sets where code is 'ALL'. That should give me the set name for the specified code. </think>  SELECT name FROM sets WHERE code = "ALL";
SELECT      name,      JSON_EXTRACT(foreign_translations, '$.language') AS language,     JSON_EXTRACT(foreign_translations, '$.name') AS translated_name FROM      cards WHERE      name = 'A Pedra Fellwar';

SELECT code FROM sets WHERE type = 'expansion'; 
SELECT c.type, f.name AS foreign_name FROM cards c JOIN foreign_translations f ON c.uuid = f.uuid WHERE c.watermark = 'Boros'; 
SELECT      flavor_text,     types FROM      cards WHERE      watermark = 'colorpie'; 
SELECT      (COUNT(CASE WHEN convertedManaCost = 10 THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS percentage FROM cards WHERE name = 'Abyssal Horror'; 
SELECT code FROM sets WHERE type = 'commander';

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE availability LIKE '%paper%' AND hand = '3'; 
SELECT name FROM cards WHERE isTextless = 0; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query to find the unconverted mana cost of the card "Ancestor's Chosen". Let me start by understanding what each part means.  First, the user is asking for the unconverted mana cost, which in Magic: The Gathering terms refers to the mana cost without considering any converted values. So I'm looking for the field that holds this information. From the database schema provided, the 'cards' table has a column named 'manaCost'. That's where the raw mana symbols are stored.  Next, I need to locate the specific card "Ancestor's Chosen". The user mentioned it refers to the name 'Ancestor`s Chosen', which is a bit unusual because of the backtick. But in the database, names are stored with standard apostrophes, so I should use that. So I'll search for where name = 'Ancestor\'s Chosen'.  Putting it together, I'll select the 'manaCost' from the 'cards' table where the name matches exactly. Since there might be multiple entries or variations, but in this case, we're specifically looking for that exact name.  I should make sure to escape the apostrophe in the name properly to avoid any SQL injection issues and ensure the query runs correctly. So the SQL statement will use 'Ancestor\'s Chosen' with an escaped apostrophe.  So the final query is straightforward: select manaCost from cards where name equals the specified string. </think>  SELECT manaCost FROM cards WHERE name = 'Ancestor\'s Chosen';
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM cards  WHERE border_color = 'white'    AND (power = '*' OR power IS NULL); 
SELECT name FROM cards WHERE isPromo = 1 AND side IS NOT NULL; 
SELECT subtypes, supertypes FROM cards WHERE name = 'Molimo, Maro-Sorcerer';

SELECT name, convertedManaCost FROM cards WHERE name = 'Serra Angel' OR name = 'Shrine Keeper'; 
SELECT artist FROM cards WHERE flavorName = 'Battra, Dark Destroyer'; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that lists the names of the top 3 cards with the highest converted mana cost and have a 2003 card frame style. Let's break this down step by step.  First, I should identify which table contains the necessary information. The question mentions "cards," so I'll look at the 'cards' table. In that table, there are columns like 'name' and 'frameVersion', which seem relevant. Also, 'convertedManaCost' is another column that's important for determining the highest costs.  The user wants only cards with a frame version of '2003'. So, I'll need to filter the results where frameVersion equals '2003'. That means adding a WHERE clause: WHERE frameVersion = '2003'.  Next, I need to get the top 3 cards by their converted mana cost. Since higher costs are desired, I should sort the results in descending order based on 'convertedManaCost'. Using ORDER BY convertedManaCost DESC will handle that.  To limit the output to just the top 3 entries, I'll add a LIMIT clause at the end: LIMIT 3.  Putting this all together, the query will select the 'name' from the 'cards' table where frameVersion is '2003', order them by convertedManaCost in descending order, and then limit the results to 3. This should give me exactly what the user asked for. </think>  SELECT name FROM cards WHERE frameVersion = '2003' ORDER BY convertedManaCost DESC LIMIT 3;

<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "What is the expansion type of the set 'Hauptset Zehnte Edition'?"   First, let me break down what's being asked here. The user wants to know the type (which they refer to as expansion type) of a specific set. The set in question is translated as 'Hauptset Zehnte Edition', which I remember from the given data is linked to the code '10E' because looking at the set_translations table, when the translation is 'Hauptset Zehnte Edition', the setCode is '10E'. So, my first step is to connect this translated name back to its corresponding set code.  Next, I need to find out what type this set has. The sets are stored in the 'sets' table, which includes a column called 'type'. Each entry in this table has an 'id', 'code', and other details, including the 'type' that we're interested in. So, the plan is:   1. Find the setCode corresponding to 'Hauptset Zehnte Edition' by querying the set_translations table. 2. Use this setCode to find the type from the sets table.  But wait, I should make sure that the translation exactly matches. The user provided the exact translation as 'Hauptset Zehnte Edition', so I need to use an exact match in the WHERE clause.  Let me think about potential issues. For example, is there a possibility of multiple translations for the same setCode? According to the data given, each setCode can have multiple translations, but each translation corresponds uniquely to one setCode. So, using the exact translation should give me the correct setCode.  Now, putting it all together:  - I'll query the set_translations table where the translation is 'Hauptset Zehnte Edition' and get the setCode. - Then, use that setCode in a subquery or join to fetch the type from the sets table.  Alternatively, I can write it as a single query using a JOIN between set_translations and sets on the code. That might be more efficient than two separate queries.  So, the SQL would look something like this:  SELECT s.type FROM sets s JOIN set_translations st ON s.code = st.setCode WHERE st.translation = 'Hauptset Zehnte Edition';  But wait, I should make sure that the setCode exists in both tables. Also, considering case sensitivity and exact matches is important.  Another approach could be using a subquery:  SELECT type FROM sets WHERE code = (SELECT setCode FROM set_translations WHERE translation = 'Hauptset Zehnte Edition');  This might be more straightforward because it directly gets the setCode from the translations and then uses it to find the type in the sets table.  I think this approach is better because it's clear and concise. It ensures that we're getting the correct type by first resolving the translation to its code.  So, finalizing the SQL statement:  SELECT type FROM sets WHERE code = (SELECT setCode FROM set_translations WHERE translation = 'Hauptset Zehnte Edition');  I should also consider if there are multiple entries in set_translations with the same translation. But in this case, since each translation is unique per setCode, it shouldn't be a problem.  Another thing to check: does the sets table have an entry for code '10E'? Looking back at the data, yes, because in the set_translations, the code is '10E' which should exist in the sets table. So this query should return the correct type. </think>  SELECT type FROM sets WHERE code = (SELECT setCode FROM set_translations WHERE translation = 'Hauptset Zehnte Edition');
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM sets  JOIN set_translations ON sets.code = set_translations.setCode  WHERE sets.block = 'Ice Age'  AND set_translations.language = 'Italian'  AND set_translations.translation IS NOT NULL; 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS non_foreign_count FROM cards c JOIN sets s ON c.setCode = s.code WHERE c.name = 'Adarkar Valkyrie' AND s.isForeignOnly != 1; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write the SQL query for the given question. Let's break it down step by step.  First, the question is asking: Among the sets of cards that have an Italian translation, how many of them have a base set number under 100?   From the extra knowledge provided: - Italian translation means the language is 'Italian'. - A translation exists if the translation field is not null. - Base set size under 100 refers to baseSetSize < 10.  So, I need to find sets that have a non-null Italian translation and where their baseSetSize is less than 10. Then count how many such sets there are.  Looking at the tables: - The 'set_translations' table has translations for each set in different languages. - The 'sets' table contains information about each set, including baseSetSize.  I'll need to join these two tables on the setCode. The condition is that the language must be Italian and translation is not null. Also, from the sets table, baseSetSize should be less than 10.  So, the SQL query will involve a LEFT JOIN between 'set_translations' and 'sets' on 'setCode'. Then, apply the WHERE conditions for language, translation being not null, and baseSetSize < 10. Finally, select the count of distinct setCodes to avoid duplicates since each set can have multiple translations.  Wait, but in the 'set_translations', each setCode might appear multiple times for different languages. So, I need to ensure that we're only considering rows where language is Italian and translation exists. Then, join with the sets table on those specific rows and filter by baseSetSize < 10.  But actually, since the question is about sets that have an Italian translation, I need to find all setCodes that exist in 'set_translations' where language is Italian and translation is not null. Then, for those setCodes, check if their baseSetSize is less than 10 in the 'sets' table.  So, perhaps a better approach is to select distinct setCode from set_translations where language = 'Italian' and translation IS NOT NULL. Then join this result with the sets table on code and count how many have baseSetSize < 10.  Alternatively, I can write it as:  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.id) FROM sets s JOIN set_translations st ON s.code = st.setCode WHERE st.language = 'Italian' AND st.translation IS NOT NULL AND s.baseSetSize < 10;  Wait, but the baseSetSize might be null. So I should also ensure that it's not null when comparing.  But according to the tables, baseSetSize is an integer and can be null. But in reality, sets usually have a baseSetSize, so maybe we don't need to handle nulls here, unless specified otherwise.  So, putting it all together:  - Join set_translations with sets on code. - Filter for Italian translations that are not null. - Further filter sets where baseSetSize < 10. - Count the distinct sets (since a set can have multiple translations).  Yes, that should give the correct count. </think>  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.id)  FROM sets s  JOIN set_translations st ON s.code = st.setCode  WHERE st.language = 'Italian' AND st.translation IS NOT NULL AND s.baseSetSize < 10;
