  To determine the user who made the most recent post and count their total posts, follow these steps:  1. **Identify the Latest Post**: Find the maximum `CreationDate` in the Posts table to identify the latest post.  2. **Determine the User ID**: Extract the `UserId` from this latest post.  3. **Count Total Posts by the User**: Count all entries in the Posts table where `UserId` matches the identified user.  **Answer:**  The user with the most recent post has a total of [number] posts. Unfortunately, without access to additional tables like Comments or Votes, we cannot provide the number of comments they've made.

  To solve this problem, we need to determine how many votes were cast on comments where each post has exactly one comment. However, based on the provided database schema, which includes only the `Posts` and `Votes` tables, it's impossible to directly link votes to comments or distinguish between votes on posts and votes on comments.  ### Approach Given the constraints of the problem, here is a step-by-step approach that highlights why the solution isn't feasible with the current schema:  1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: We have two tables: `Posts` and `Votes`. 2. **Understand Relationships**: The `Posts` table contains information about posts, including the number of comments each post has (`CommentCount`). The `Votes` table contains votes, but without a way to link these votes specifically to comments or posts. 3. **Distinguish Votes on Comments**: Without a separate table for comments and their respective votes, there's no clear way to determine which votes are associated with comments rather than posts. 4. **Conclusion**: Due to the lack of necessary tables (e.g., `Comments` and `CommentVotes`) and without additional columns that distinguish between post votes and comment votes, it's impossible to accurately count the votes on comments for posts with exactly one comment.  ### Solution Code Since the problem cannot be solved with the given schema, we can explain why this is the case. However, if we assume an idealized structure where each vote on a comment is recorded in a separate table or has a unique identifier, the approach would involve joining relevant tables and counting votes based on those identifiers.  ### Explanation The solution hinges on having additional data structures that link comments to their respective posts and track votes on these comments. Without this information, it's impossible to determine which votes correspond to comments on posts with exactly one comment. Therefore, the problem requires a more comprehensive database schema to be solvable as intended.

  To address your question about finding the up vote count of the user who made the comment "R is also lazy evaluated," I must note that based on the provided database schema, there isn't a 'comments' table available. This makes it impossible to directly query for the specific comment text.  However, if we were to assume that such a table exists or if the comment can be linked through another method (which isn't evident from the current schema), the approach would involve:  1. Retrieving the user ID from the hypothetical 'comments' table where the comment text matches. 2. Using this user ID to find their up vote count in the 'users' table.  Without the necessary tables, it's not feasible to provide a correct SQL query for your request. If you have access to additional tables or more details about how comments are stored, please provide that information so I can assist further.
