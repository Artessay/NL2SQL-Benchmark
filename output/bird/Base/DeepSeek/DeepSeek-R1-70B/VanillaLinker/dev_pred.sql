SELECT MAX(`Free Meal Count (K-12)` / `Enrollment (K-12)`) AS max_eligible_rate  FROM frpm  WHERE `County Name` = 'Alameda'  AND `Enrollment (K-12)` > 0  AND `Free Meal Count (K-12)` > 0; 
SELECT      `School Name`,     (`Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) AS EligibleFreeRate FROM      frpm WHERE      `Educational Option Type` = 'Continuation'     AND `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` > 0 ORDER BY      EligibleFreeRate ASC LIMIT 3; 
SELECT s.Zip  FROM frpm f INNER JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE f.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 AND s.County = 'Fresno'; 
SELECT T2.MailStreet  FROM frpm AS T1  INNER JOIN schools AS T2  ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode  WHERE T1.`FRPM Count (K-12)` IS NOT NULL  ORDER BY T1.`FRPM Count (K-12)` DESC  LIMIT 1; 
SELECT s.Phone  FROM frpm f  INNER JOIN schools s  ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode  WHERE f.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 AND s.FundingType = 'Direct Charter' AND s.OpenDate > '2000-01-01'; 
<think> Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this SQL query. The user wants to know how many schools have an average math SAT score greater than 400 and are exclusively virtual, which means their Virtual field is set to 'F'.   First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The satscores table has the SAT data, including AvgScrMath, which is the average math score. The schools table contains information about each school, including whether it's virtual.  I should join these two tables on the CDSCode since that's the common identifier between them. Using an INNER JOIN makes sense here because we need matching records in both tables.  Next, I'll set up the WHERE clause to filter for AvgScrMath > 400 and Virtual = 'F'. This ensures we only count schools meeting both criteria.  Finally, I'll use COUNT(*) to tally the number of qualifying schools and alias it as NumSchools for clarity. Putting it all together, the SQL query should join the tables, apply the filters, and count the results. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumSchools FROM satscores INNER JOIN schools ON satscores.cds = schools.CDSCode WHERE AvgScrMath > 400 AND Virtual = 'F'
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.  The question is: Among the schools with SAT test takers over 500, list those that are magnet schools or offer a magnet program. From the extra knowledge provided, I know that being a magnet school means the Magnet field in the schools table is 1.  Looking at the database schema, I see three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The relevant data here is split between satscores and schools.  First, I need to find schools where the number of SAT test takers (NumTstTakr) is greater than 500. That information is in the satscores table. So, I'll select from satscores where NumTstTakr > 500.  Next, these schools must be magnet schools or offer a magnet program. The Magnet field in the schools table indicates this with a value of 1. Therefore, I need to join the satscores table with the schools table on the CDSCode field since that's the primary key common to both tables.  I should use an INNER JOIN to combine these two tables. This way, I only get records where both tables have matching CDSCodes.  Now, I want specific information about each school. The user probably wants the school name and maybe some identifiers. So, I'll include sname (school name), cds (CDSCode from satscores), and perhaps dname (district name) for clarity, though the question doesn't specify needing district info. But since sname is in satscores, that's sufficient.  Putting it all together, my SELECT statement will include sname, cds, and maybe dname to make the output informative. The FROM clause starts with satscores, then INNER JOINs with schools on CDSCode. The WHERE clauses are NumTstTakr > 500 and Magnet = 1.  I should double-check if there are any other conditions or joins needed, but from what I can tell, this covers the requirements. </think>  SELECT sname, cds, dname FROM satscores INNER JOIN schools ON satscores.cds = schools.CDSCode WHERE NumTstTakr > 500 AND Magnet = 1;
SELECT s.Phone FROM schools s INNER JOIN satscores sa ON s.CDSCode = sa.cds WHERE sa.NumGE1500 = (SELECT MAX(NumGE1500) FROM satscores) LIMIT 1; 
SELECT SUM(s.NumTstTakr) AS TotalTestTakers FROM satscores s WHERE s.cds IN (     SELECT f.CDSCode     FROM frpm f     WHERE `FRPM Count (K-12)` = (         SELECT MAX(`FRPM Count (K-12)`)         FROM frpm     ) ); 
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM satscores s JOIN frpm f ON s.CDSCode = f.CDSCode WHERE s.AvgScrMath > 560 AND f.CharterSchoolYN = 1; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers this specific question: "For the school with the highest average score in Reading in the SAT test, what is its FRPM count for students aged 5-17?"   Let me break it down step by step.  First, I know there are three tables involved: frpm, satscores, and schools. The question is asking about a school's FRPM count from the frpm table, but to get that, I need information from both satscores and frpm because the highest average reading score comes from satscores.  So, step one is to find which school has the highest average reading score. In the satscores table, the relevant column for reading is AvgScrRead. I'll need to find the maximum value of this column. That will give me the top score.  Once I have that score, I can get the CDSCode (which is the primary key) from the satscores table where the AvgScrRead equals that maximum value. But wait, what if there are multiple schools with the same highest average? Hmm, the question doesn't specify handling ties, so maybe it's safe to assume there's a single school or we just pick one.  Next, I need to link this CDSCode to the frpm table because that's where FRPM counts are stored. Specifically, the column is 'FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)'. So, I'll join satscores and frpm on their CDSCode fields.  Wait, actually, in the schools table, each school has a CDSCode which is a primary key. Both satscores and frpm reference this CDSCode via foreign keys. So, to get from satscores to frpm, I can use the CDSCode as the common key.  Here's how it might go:  1. Select the maximum AvgScrRead from satscores. 2. Find the CDSCode(s) associated with that maximum value. 3. Use that CDSCode to find the corresponding FRPM count in frpm.  So, I can structure this with a subquery. The inner query finds the max average reading score and then gets the CDSCode where AvgScrRead equals that max. Then the outer query selects the FRPM count from frpm where CDSCode matches.  Wait, but in SQL, sometimes when you have multiple columns, you might need to aggregate or group, but here we just want a single value—the highest average—and its corresponding school's CDSCode. So, maybe using MAX and then selecting the CDSCode with that MAX.  Putting it together:  SELECT `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` FROM frpm WHERE CDSCode = ( SELECT cds FROM satscores WHERE AvgScrRead = ( SELECT MAX(AvgScrRead) FROM satscores ) )  But wait, what if there are multiple schools with the same highest average? The subquery would return multiple CDSCodes, but the outer query expects a single value. In that case, maybe I should limit it to one or use another method.  Alternatively, since each CDSCode is unique (as it's a primary key in all tables), there shouldn't be duplicates. So, perhaps it's safe as is.  Another approach could be ordering by AvgScrRead descending and taking the first row's CDSCode, then using that to get the FRPM count.  Like:  SELECT `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` FROM frpm WHERE CDSCode = (     SELECT cds FROM satscores ORDER BY AvgScrRead DESC LIMIT 1 )  But which method is better? Using MAX might be more efficient because it doesn't require ordering all records, just finding the maximum. But both should work.  I think using MAX is clearer in intent here. So I'll go with the first approach. </think>  SELECT `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` FROM frpm WHERE CDSCode = ( SELECT cds FROM satscores WHERE AvgScrRead = ( SELECT MAX(AvgScrRead) FROM satscores ) )
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's request. The question is asking for the codes of schools where the total enrollment exceeds 500. From the extra knowledge provided, I know that the total enrollment should be calculated by adding two fields: `Enrollment (K-12)` and `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`.   First, I'll look at the database schema to see which tables have these enrollment fields. The `frpm` table has both `Enrollment (K-12)` and `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` columns. So, my query will focus on this table.  I need to select the primary key from the `frpm` table since the question asks for school codes. The primary key here is `CDSCode`.  Next, I'll set up the condition in the WHERE clause. The sum of the two enrollment fields should be greater than 500. So, the condition will be `[Enrollment (K-12)] + [Enrollment (Ages 5-17)] > 500`.   I should also consider if there are any NULL values in these columns because adding NULL could affect the result. However, since the user didn't specify handling NULLs, I'll proceed without additional checks unless it's necessary.  Putting it all together, the SQL query will select `CDSCode` from `frpm` where the sum of enrollments exceeds 500. </think>  SELECT CDSCode FROM frpm WHERE [Enrollment (K-12)] + [Enrollment (Ages 5-17)] > 500
SELECT MAX(`Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) AS max_free_rate FROM satscores INNER JOIN frpm ON cds = CDSCode WHERE (NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr) > 0.3 AND `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` > 0; 
SELECT s.Phone FROM schools s JOIN satscores sa ON s.CDSCode = sa.cds WHERE sa.NumGE1500 IS NOT NULL AND sa.NumTstTakr > 0 ORDER BY (sa.NumGE1500 / sa.NumTstTakr) DESC LIMIT 3; 
SELECT s.NCESSchool, f.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` FROM frpm f JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode ORDER BY f.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` DESC LIMIT 5; 
SELECT district FROM (   SELECT scho.District AS district, AVG(sat.AvgScrRead) AS avg_read_score   FROM schools scho   JOIN satscores sat ON scho.CDSCode = sat.cds   WHERE scho.StatusType = 'Active'   GROUP BY scho.District   ORDER BY avg_read_score DESC ) AS subquery WHERE ROWNUM <= 1; 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.CDSCode)  FROM frpm f  INNER JOIN satscores sa ON f.CDSCode = sa.cds  INNER JOIN schools sc ON sa.cds = sc.CDSCode  WHERE sc.County = 'Alameda' AND sa.NumTstTakr < 100; 
<think> Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the SQL query for the user's question.  First, the user wants to rank schools based on their average writing scores where the score exceeds 499 and also display their charter numbers. They mentioned that a valid charter number isn't null, so I need to include only those schools where `CharterNum` is not null.  Looking at the database schema, the `satscores` table holds the SAT data, including `AvgScrWrite`, which is the average writing score. The `schools` table contains the `CharterNum` and other school details. Since both tables have `CDSCode` as a primary key, I can join them on this field to access data from both.  I need to filter schools where `AvgScrWrite` > 499. Also, `CharterNum` shouldn't be null, so I'll include that condition in the WHERE clause.   To rank the schools, using `ORDER BY AvgScrWrite DESC` makes sense because higher scores should come first. This way, the schools are listed from highest to lowest average writing score.  I have to make sure to select only the necessary columns: school name (`School`), average writing score (`AvgScrWrite`), and charter number (`CharterNum`).   Putting it all together, I'll join the two tables on `CDSCode`, apply the filters, and sort the results accordingly. </think>  SELECT s.School, ss.AvgScrWrite, s.CharterNum FROM schools s JOIN satscores ss ON s.CDSCode = ss.cds WHERE ss.AvgScrWrite > 499 AND s.CharterNum IS NOT NULL ORDER BY ss.AvgScrWrite DESC;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.CDSCode) FROM satscores sc INNER JOIN schools s ON sc.cds = s.CDSCode WHERE sc.rtype = 'S'   AND s.County = 'Fresno'   AND s.FundingType = 'Directly Funded'   AND sc.NumTstTakr <= 250; 
SELECT s.Phone FROM schools s WHERE s.CDSCode IN (SELECT sa.cds FROM satscores sa WHERE sa.rtype = 'S' AND sa.AvgScrMath = (SELECT MAX(AvgScrMath) FROM satscores WHERE rtype = 'S')); 
SELECT COUNT(CDSCode)  FROM frpm  WHERE `County Name` = 'Amador' AND `Low Grade` = '9' AND `High Grade` = '12'; 
SELECT COUNT(CDSCode) FROM frpm WHERE `County Name` = 'Los Angeles' AND `Free Meal Count (K-12)` > 500 AND `FRPM Count (K-12)` < 700; 
SELECT      s.School,     SUM(sa.NumTstTakr) as total_takers FROM      schools s INNER JOIN      satscores sa ON s.CDSCode = sa.cds WHERE      s.County = 'Contra Costa' GROUP BY      s.School ORDER BY      total_takers DESC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT s.School, s.Street || ', ' || s.City || ', ' || s.Zip AS Address FROM frpm f INNER JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE (f.`Enrollment (K-12)` - f.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) > 30; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me break it down step by step.  First, the user is asking for the names of schools that meet two specific criteria:  1. The percentage of students eligible for free meals in K-12 is more than 0.1. 2. The number of test takers with scores greater than or equal to 1500 is at least a certain amount. Wait, actually, looking back, the question says "test takers whose test score is greater than or equal to 1500." So I think it's about the count being non-zero or meeting some threshold.  Looking at the database schema provided:  - There are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. - The 'frpm' table has information about free meal eligibility. It includes columns like 'Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)', which is named as 'PercentEligibleFreeK12'. So that's where the first condition comes from. - The 'satscores' table has test-related data, including 'NumGE1500', which I assume stands for Number of students who scored 1500 or above. So this is the second condition.  The schools' names are in both 'frpm' and 'schools' tables as 'School Name' and 'School', respectively.  Now, to join these tables correctly. Each table has a CDSCode which links them. So I'll need to join frpm with satscores on CDSCode, but since the schools table also contains CDSCode, maybe I should join all three or just the necessary ones. Wait, actually, in the schema, 'frpm' and 'satscores' both reference 'schools' via their foreign keys, so each has CDSCode as primary key which links to schools.  But for this query, since we're selecting the school name from either frpm or schools, perhaps I can join frpm with satscores directly. Wait, looking at the tables, 'frpm' and 'satscores' both have CDSCode as their primary keys? No, wait: in frpm, it's TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, same for satscores, cds is TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY. So yes, they can be joined on CDSCode.  So the plan is:  1. Select 'School Name' from frpm where PercentEligibleFreeK12 > 0.1. 2. Join with satscores where NumGE1500 >= some number. Wait, but what's the condition exactly? The user says "test takers whose test score is greater than or equal to 1500." So it's about having at least one such student, so maybe NumGE1500 > 0. Or perhaps they require a specific count, but since the question isn't clear on that, I think we just need to ensure that there are any students with scores >=1500.  Wait, looking back at the satscores table, 'NumGE1500' is INTEGER and can be NULL. So in the query, I should include where NumGE1500 > 0 or IS NOT NULL? Hmm, but if it's zero, then no test takers met that score. So perhaps the condition is NumGE1500 IS NOT NULL AND >=1.  But maybe the user just wants schools where there are any such test takers. Alternatively, perhaps they need to have at least some number, say more than zero.  Wait, looking back, the question says "test takers whose test score is greater than or equal to 1500." So it's about having at least one such test taker. Therefore, in 'satscores', we need to find schools where NumGE1500 >=1.  But wait, looking at the satscores table, 'NumGE1500' can be NULL if there are no such students. So perhaps the condition should be NumGE1500 > 0. Alternatively, if it's NULL, that means zero or not applicable.  Wait, but in the data, if a school has zero test takers scoring >=1500, then 'NumGE1500' would probably be 0, not NULL. But some schools might not have any SAT data at all, so maybe they don't appear in satscores. Therefore, to include only schools that have at least one such test taker, we can join on CDSCode and set the condition as NumGE1500 >=1.  Wait, but if a school isn't present in satscores, it means they didn't have any SAT data. So when joining, using an INNER JOIN would exclude those schools without any SAT scores.  But wait, the question is about schools that have both: percent eligible free meals > 0.1 and at least one test taker with score >=1500. Therefore, we need to join frpm with satscores on CDSCode where NumGE1500 >=1.  Additionally, since each school's name appears in 'frpm' as SchoolName, I can select that directly without needing the schools table.  Wait, let me check: 'frpm' has 'School Name'? Or does it? Looking back at the schema, the column is named 'School Name' (yes, in frpm). So yes, we can get the name from there.  So putting it all together:  - Select SchoolName from frpm. - Join with satscores on CDSCode. - Apply conditions: PercentEligibleFreeK12 > 0.1 and NumGE1500 >=1.  Also, since in SQL, column names might have spaces, so we need to use quotes or brackets. For example, 'Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)' would be written as "PercentEligibleFreeK12" if it's an alias or using the actual name with proper formatting.  Wait, looking at the frpm table schema, the column is named:  'Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)'  So in SQL, when referencing this column, I have to use square brackets or quotes. So [Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)] > 0.1  Similarly, 'NumGE1500' is a column name without spaces.  Therefore, the SQL query would be:  SELECT f.[School Name] FROM frpm f JOIN satscores s ON f.CDSCode = s.cds WHERE f.[Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)] > 0.1 AND s.NumGE1500 >= 1;  Wait, but in the satscores table, the CDSCode is named 'cds', so in lowercase? Or is it 'CDSCode'? Looking back: the satscores table has 'cds' as TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY. So yes, it's lowercase.  So in the JOIN, we have to match f.CDSCode with s.cds. But wait, are they case-sensitive? In SQL Server, object names are case-insensitive by default, but string comparisons can be case-sensitive. However, when joining on columns, it's typically better to ensure that the join is correct regardless of case.  But in this case, I think the CDSCode in frpm and satscores should match exactly, so perhaps the join is fine as f.CDSCode = s.cds, assuming that the data uses the same case.  Alternatively, maybe it's better to use a case-insensitive comparison or convert both sides to uppercase. But for simplicity, I'll proceed with f.CDSCode = s.cds.  Wait, but in frpm, CDSCode is capitalized as 'CDSCode', while in satscores, it's 'cds'. So when joining, we have to match the column names correctly.  So perhaps the correct join condition is f.CDSCode = s.cds. So that's correct.  Putting it all together:  SELECT f.[School Name] FROM frpm f INNER JOIN satscores s ON f.CDSCode = s.cds WHERE f.[Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)] > 0.1 AND s.NumGE1500 >= 1;  Wait, but the user just wants schools where both conditions are met: percent eligible free meals in K-12 is more than 0.1 and test takers with scores >=1500. So this query should do that.  I think that's it. So the final SQL statement selects the school names from frpm where the percentage is over 0.1, joined with satscores where NumGE1500 is at least 1. </think>  SELECT f.[School Name] FROM frpm f INNER JOIN satscores s ON f.CDSCode = s.cds WHERE f.[Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)] > 0.1 AND s.NumGE1500 >= 1;
SELECT SchoolName, FundingType FROM schools WHERE County = 'SpecificCounty'; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me break it down step by step.  First, the user is asking for the names and full communication addresses of high schools in Monterey that have more than 800 free or reduced price meals (FRPM) for ages 15-17.   Looking at the database schema provided, I see three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The relevant information seems to be split between these tables.  1. **Identifying the Correct Table**: The FRPM data is in the 'frpm' table. Specifically, the column 'FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)' holds the count of free or reduced price meals for that age group.  2. **Determining High Schools**: To identify high schools, I need a way to distinguish them from other types of schools. The 'School Type' in the frpm table could help, but it's NULL often. Another approach is the 'High Grade' column in frpm or possibly the 'GSoffered' in schools, which might indicate grade levels.  3. **Location Information**: The full communication address includes Street, City, State, and Zip. This information is in the 'schools' table under Street, City, State, and Zip columns.  4. **Joining Tables**: Since both frpm and schools contain necessary info, I'll need to join them on their common key. Both have CDSCode as a primary key, so that's the link.  5. **Filtering Monterey County**: The 'County Name' in frpm should be 'Monterey'.  6. **Handling NULLs**: Some columns might have NULL values, especially in the schools table for address fields. I'll use COALESCE to handle NULLs and provide a placeholder like 'N/A' if necessary.  7. **Selecting Columns**: I need School Name from frpm (aliased as s_name) and all address components from schools.  Putting it all together, I join frpm and schools on CDSCode, filter by Monterey County, check that FRPM Count for ages 5-17 is over 800, handle NULLs in address fields, and select the required columns. </think>  SELECT      s.School,     COALESCE(frs.`School Name`, 'N/A') AS s_name,     COALESCE(s.Street, 'N/A'),     COALESCE(s.City, 'N/A'),     COALESCE(s.State, 'N/A'),     COALESCE(s.Zip, 'N/A') FROM `frpm` frs JOIN schools s ON frs.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE frs.`County Name` = 'Monterey' AND frs.`FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` > 800
<think> Alright, I need to tackle this SQL query problem. Let me read through the question again carefully.  The user wants to find the average writing score for schools that were either opened after 1991 or closed before 2000. They also want the school names along with the scores and the phone numbers if available.  First, I'll look at the database schema provided. The main tables involved seem to be 'schools', 'frpm', and 'satscores'. Since the question is about SAT writing scores, I should focus on the 'satscores' table because that's where the test data is stored.  Next, I need to link this with the 'schools' table because it contains information about when schools opened or closed. The 'OpenDate' and 'ClosedDate' fields are in the 'schools' table, so I'll need to join these two tables on their common key, which is CDSCode. The 'satscores' table uses 'cds' as its primary key, which corresponds to 'CDSCode' in the other tables.  The question mentions two conditions: schools opened after 1991 or closed before 2000. So I'll set up a WHERE clause that checks if OpenDate is after '1991-12-31' (which effectively means any date in 1992 or later) OR ClosedDate is before '2000-01-01'.  I need to calculate the average writing score, which is stored as 'AvgScrWrite' in 'satscores'. I'll use the AVG() function for this and group the results by school name from the 'schools' table.  Additionally, the user wants the phone number if available. The 'Phone' field in the 'schools' table holds that information, so I'll include it in the SELECT statement.  Putting it all together, I'll write a SQL query that joins the two tables on CDSCode, applies the date conditions, groups by school name, and selects the required fields.  I should also make sure to handle cases where AvgScrWrite might be NULL or where Phone is not available. Using COALESCE can help format NULLs as 'N/A' for clarity, but since the user didn't specify, I'll note that but proceed without it unless instructed otherwise.  Finally, I'll structure the query to include all necessary components: joining tables, filtering with WHERE, grouping, and selecting the required data. </think>  SELECT s.SchoolName, AVG(sa.AvgScrWrite) AS AverageWritingScore, s.Phone FROM schools s INNER JOIN satscores sa ON s.CDSCode = sa.cds WHERE OpenDate > '1991-12-31' OR ClosedDate < '2000-01-01' GROUP BY s.SchoolName
WITH avg_diff AS (   SELECT AVG(f.Enrollment_K12 - f.Enrollment_Ages_5_17) AS avg_diff   FROM frpm f   INNER JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode   WHERE s.FundingType = 'Local' ) SELECT s.School, s.DOCType FROM frpm f INNER JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE s.FundingType = 'Local' AND (f.[Enrollment (K-12)] - f.[Enrollment (Ages 5-17)]) > (SELECT avg_diff FROM avg_diff); 
SELECT s.OpenDate FROM frpm f JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE f.`Enrollment (K-12)` = (SELECT MAX(`Enrollment (K-12)`) FROM frpm) LIMIT 1; 
<think> Alright, let's tackle this SQL problem. The user is asking which cities have the top 5 lowest enrollment numbers for students in grades 1 through 12. From the provided schema, I know that K-12 refers to grades 1 through 12.  First, I need to find the right table with enrollment data. Looking at the tables, `frpm` has a column `Enrollment (K-12)` which is exactly what we need. So, the main focus will be on this table.  Next, the user wants the cities. The city information isn't directly in `frpm`; it's in the `schools` table under the `City` column. Therefore, I should join these two tables to link the enrollment data with city names.  To join them, both tables have a common key: `CDSCode` in `frpm` and `CDSCode` in `schools`. So, an INNER JOIN on `CDSCode` makes sense here.  Now, I need to order the results. Since we're looking for the lowest enrollments, I'll sort by `Enrollment (K-12)` in ascending order.  To get the top 5, I should limit the query to return only five entries. Using LIMIT 5 at the end of the query will handle that.  Putting it all together, I'll select the city from `schools`, join with `frpm` on their CDSCode, order by enrollment ascending, and limit the results to five. This should give me the cities with the top 5 lowest enrollments. </think>  SELECT City FROM schools INNER JOIN frpm ON schools.CDSCode = frpm.CDSCode ORDER BY `Enrollment (K-12)` ASC LIMIT 5
SELECT      s.SchoolName,     (f.`Free Meal Count (K-12)` / f.`Enrollment (K-12)`) AS EligibleFreeRate FROM (     SELECT          CDSCode,         SchoolName,         `Enrollment (K-12)`,         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY `Enrollment (K-12)` DESC) AS Rank     FROM frpm ) s WHERE Rank IN (10, 11); 
<think> Alright, so I need to help the user by writing an SQL query based on their question. Let me break down what they're asking.  The question is: "What is the eligible free or reduced price meal rate for the top 5 schools in grades 1-12 with the highest free or reduced price meal count of the schools with the ownership code 66?"  First, I need to understand the database schema. There are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The relevant columns seem to be in the frpm table because it contains information about Free Meal counts and Enrollment.  The user mentions "grades 1-12" but notes that this corresponds to "K-12". So I should use columns like `FRPM Count (K-12)` and `Enrollment (K-12)` from the frpm table.  They want the top 5 schools by FRPM count, so I'll need to sort by `FRPM Count (K-12)` in descending order and limit the results to 5. Also, these schools must have an ownership code of 66. Looking at the schema, I think the "ownership code" might be in the 'EdOpsCode' column in the schools table because that's a common place for such codes.  Wait, actually, checking the schools table, there are several code fields like EdOpsCode and EILCode. The user didn't specify which one is the ownership code, but since '66' is often used as a district code or something similar, perhaps it's stored in 'EdOpsCode'. Alternatively, maybe it's in the 'County Code' or another field. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll proceed with 'EdOpsCode' for now.  So, to get the ownership code 66, I need to join the frpm table with the schools table on CDSCode and filter where EdOpsCode = '66'.   The eligible rate is calculated as FRPM Count divided by Enrollment. So in SQL, it would be `FRPM Count (K-12)` / `Enrollment (K-12)`.  Putting this together, I should select the School Name, FRPM Count, and the calculated rate from frpm, join with schools on CDSCode, filter where EdOpsCode is 66, order by FRPM count descending, and limit to top 5.  Wait a second, in the frpm table, 'School Name' is a column. So I can directly select it without needing the schools table for that. But since the ownership code is in the schools table, I do need to join.  So the SQL structure would be:  SELECT      s.Name,     f.FRPC,     (f.FRPM / f.Enrollment) as Rate FROM frpm f JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE s.EdOpsCode = '66' ORDER BY f.FRPM DESC LIMIT 5;  But I need to ensure the correct column names. Looking back, in frpm, it's `FRPM Count (K-12)` and `Enrollment (K-12)`. So I'll use those exact names.  Also, checking if EdOpsCode is the right field for ownership code 66. If it isn't, maybe it's another column like 'County Code' or something else. But without more info, I'll proceed with EdOpsCode.  So final query would select School Name, FRPM Count, calculate the rate, join on CDSCode, filter EdOpsCode = 66, order by FRPM count descending, and limit to 5. </think>  SELECT `School Name`, `FRPM Count (K-12)`, (`FRPM Count (K-12)` / `Enrollment (K-12)`) AS EligibleFreeRate FROM frpm WHERE `EdOpsCode` = '66' ORDER BY `FRPM Count (K-12)` DESC LIMIT 5
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me break down what they're asking for.  The user wants to find the website addresses of schools where the free meal count for students aged 5-17 is between 1,900 and 2,000. They also want the school names included in the results.  First, I should identify which table contains the relevant information. The 'frpm' table has a column called 'Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)' which seems to be what we need. This table also has the 'School Name', so that's good because the user wants both the website and school name.  However, the 'Website' field isn't in the 'frpm' table; it's in the 'schools' table. So I'll need to join these two tables on a common key. Both tables have a 'CDSCode' column which is the primary key for the 'frpm' and 'schools' tables, so that will be my joining point.  Next, I'll set up the SELECT statement to include 'Website' from 'schools' and 'School Name' from 'frpm'. Then, I'll use an INNER JOIN between 'frpm' and 'schools' on their 'CDSCode' fields.  Now, the WHERE clause needs to filter where 'Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)' is between 1,900 and 2,000. So I'll write that condition to ensure only those rows are selected.  Putting it all together, I structure the query to select the required columns, join the tables, and apply the necessary condition. </think>  SELECT s.Website, f.`School Name` FROM frpm f INNER JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE f.`Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
SELECT      (T1.`Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / T1.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) * 100 AS FreeRate FROM frpm T1 JOIN schools T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode WHERE      (T2.AdmFName1 = 'Kacey' AND T2.AdmLName1 = 'Gibson')     OR (T2.AdmFName2 = 'Kacey' AND T2.AdmLName2 = 'Gibson')     OR (T2.AdmFName3 = 'Kacey' AND T2.AdmLName3 = 'Gibson'); 
SELECT T2.AdmEmail1 || T2.AdmEmail2 || T2.AdmEmail3 AS Administrator_Email FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode WHERE T1.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 AND T1.`Enrollment (K-12)` = (     SELECT MIN(`Enrollment (K-12)`)     FROM frpm     WHERE `Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 ) LIMIT 1; 
SELECT s.AdmFName1, s.AdmLName1, s.AdmFName2, s.AdmLName2, s.AdmFName3, s.AdmLName3  FROM schools s  WHERE s.CDSCode IN (   SELECT sc.cds    FROM satscores sc    WHERE sc.NumGE1500 = (SELECT MAX(NumGE1500) FROM satscores) ); 
<think> Alright, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "What is the complete address of the school with the lowest excellence rate? Indicate the Street, City, Zip and State."   First, let's break down what the user is asking for. They want the complete address, which includes Street, City, Zip, and State. The key here is to find the school with the lowest excellence rate. From the extra knowledge provided, I know that the excellence rate is calculated as NumGE1500 divided by NumTstTakr, both of which are fields in the satscores table.  So, my first thought is to look at the satscores table because it contains the necessary data for calculating the excellence rate. The formula would be ExcellenceRate = NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr. However, I should also consider cases where NumTstTakr might be zero to avoid division by zero errors. But since this is a school's test scores, it's likely that NumTstTakr won't be zero if there are any test takers.  Next, I need to find the school with the lowest excellence rate. To do this, I can calculate the excellence rate for each school and then order them from lowest to highest. The school at the top of this ordered list would have the lowest rate.  But wait, the schools table contains the address information—Street, City, Zip, and State. So, I need to join the satscores table with the schools table on their common key. Looking at the schemas, both tables have a CDSCode field which is the primary key in schools and cds in satscores. So, I should use this to link them.  I'll probably use an INNER JOIN or perhaps a LEFT JOIN depending on whether all schools in satscores exist in schools. Since it's likely that every school in satscores is also in schools, an INNER JOIN should suffice.  Now, putting it together: I need to select the address fields from the schools table but only for the school with the minimum excellence rate. To do this efficiently, I might first calculate the excellence rates, order them, and then pick the top one.  One approach could be to use a subquery to find the minimum excellence rate and then select the school(s) that have that rate. Alternatively, I can sort all schools by their excellence rate in ascending order and take the first one.  Let me sketch this out:  1. Calculate ExcellenceRate for each school. 2. Find the minimum ExcellenceRate among them. 3. Select the school(s) with that rate. 4. Retrieve their complete address from the schools table.  But, in SQL, to get the top record based on a calculated field, I can use ORDER BY and LIMIT 1. So, perhaps the most straightforward way is to compute the excellence rate, sort by it, and pick the first entry.  So, the structure would be:  SELECT schools.Street, schools.City, schools.Zip, schools.State FROM satscores INNER JOIN schools ON satscores.cds = schools.CDSCode WHERE (satscores.NumGE1500 / satscores.NumTstTakr) =      (SELECT MIN(NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr) FROM satscores)  But wait, what if multiple schools have the same lowest rate? The user might want all of them. But since they asked for "the school," maybe just one is intended.  Alternatively, using ORDER BY and LIMIT:  SELECT schools.Street, schools.City, schools.Zip, schools.State FROM satscores INNER JOIN schools ON satscores.cds = schools.CDSCode ORDER BY (NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr) ASC LIMIT 1;  But I'm not sure if ORDER BY works directly with calculated fields without first selecting them. So perhaps I should calculate the rate in a subquery or use it in the WHERE clause as earlier.  Wait, another thought: Using the MIN function might miss cases where multiple schools have the same minimum rate. Also, using LIMIT 1 ensures we only get one school, which aligns with the question's phrasing.  Another consideration is that some schools might not have any test takers (NumTstTakr = 0), but since NumGE1500 can't be negative and if there are no test takers, perhaps their excellence rate is zero or undefined. But in reality, a school would only have an entry in satscores if they had test takers, so maybe this isn't an issue.  Let me think about the exact SQL syntax:  I need to join the two tables on cds/CDSCode. Then, for each row, compute NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr as the excellence rate. Then find the school with the minimum of that value and return its address.  Using a subquery in the WHERE clause seems appropriate. So first, calculate the minimum excellence rate across all schools, then select the school(s) where their rate equals this minimum.  But to get the minimum, I can compute it by selecting MIN(NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr) from satscores.  So, putting it together:  SELECT s.Street, s.City, s.State, s.Zip FROM schools s INNER JOIN satscores sc ON s.CDSCode = sc.cds WHERE (sc.NumGE1500 / sc.NumTstTakr) = (     SELECT MIN(NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr)     FROM satscores );  But wait, what if a school has multiple entries in satscores? Maybe not, since each entry is likely per year or something. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that each cds in satscores corresponds to one row.  Alternatively, maybe I should group by schools.CDSCode and calculate their overall excellence rate. That's a possibility if a school has multiple entries in satscores. For example, if a school has test scores from different years or different tests, we might need to aggregate NumGE1500 and NumTstTakr.  Wait, the question is about the school with the lowest excellence rate, so it depends on whether each row in satscores represents all the test takers for that school. If each row is per test instance (e.g., SAT, ACT), then we might need to sum across all instances for a school to get total NumGE1500 and total NumTstTakr.  But looking at the schema again, it's not clear how satscores are structured—whether each row represents a single test administration or aggregates. If each school has only one row in satscores, then no problem. But if they have multiple, we need to aggregate.  Assuming that each school can have multiple rows (e.g., different tests), then for each school, the excellence rate would be total NumGE1500 divided by total NumTstTakr across all their entries.  In that case, I should first group satscores by cds, summing both NumGE1500 and NumTstTakr, then calculate the excellence rate per school.  So, the query would involve grouping:  SELECT schools.Street, schools.City, schools.State, schools.Zip FROM (     SELECT cds,            SUM(NumGE1500) AS TotalGE,            SUM(NumTstTakr) AS TotalTestTakers     FROM satscores     GROUP BY cds ) sc INNER JOIN schools ON sc.cds = schools.CDSCode WHERE (sc.TotalGE / sc.TotalTestTakers) = (     SELECT MIN(TotalGE / TotalTestTakers)     FROM (         SELECT cds,                SUM(NumGE1500) AS TotalGE,                SUM(NumTstTakr) AS TotalTestTakers         FROM satscores         GROUP BY cds     ) sub );  But that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, using a Common Table Expression (CTE) might make it cleaner.  But perhaps in this case, since the question is about individual schools and their test scores, each school has only one row in satscores. So maybe I don't need to group by cds.  Alternatively, if multiple rows exist per school, then grouping is necessary. Since the problem doesn't specify, but for thoroughness, perhaps grouping would be better.  However, given time constraints, I might proceed under the assumption that each school has one row in satscores, so no aggregation is needed beyond what's already there.  Thus, the initial approach of joining schools and satscores on cds/CDSCode, calculating excellence rate as NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr for each row, then selecting the school with the minimum rate would suffice.  So, putting it all together, the SQL query would:  - Join the two tables. - Where the calculated rate equals the minimum across all schools. - Select the address fields from schools.  I think that's the correct approach. Now, let me write this without any comments as per the user's instruction. </think>  SELECT s.Street, s.City, s.State, s.Zip FROM schools s INNER JOIN satscores sc ON s.CDSCode = sc.cds WHERE (sc.NumGE1500 / sc.NumTstTakr) = (     SELECT MIN(NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr)     FROM satscores );
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for the websites of schools in Los Angeles County that have between 2,000 and 3,000 test takers.  First, I should break down the components of the question:  1. **Website Information**: This is the main data point we need to extract. It's stored in the `Website` column of the `schools` table.  2. **Los Angeles County**: The county name is specified as Los Angeles. In the database schema provided, the `County Name` is part of the `frpm` table and the `County` is also present in the `schools` table. However, since we're joining multiple tables, I'll need to check where this information is accessed from.  3. **Test Takers Count**: The number of test takers is given as between 2,000 and 3,000. Looking at the `satscores` table, there's a column called `NumTstTakr`, which represents the number of test takers. So I'll need to use this column in my WHERE clause.  Next, I should consider how these tables relate. The `frpm` and `schools` tables are connected via the `CDSCode`. The `satscores` table also references this `cds` as a foreign key. Therefore, I can join all three tables using their respective keys.  Here's the step-by-step plan:  - **Join the Tables**: Since both `frpm` and `satscores` reference the `CDSCode`, I'll join `frpm` with `schools` on `CDSCode`, and then join `satscores` with them as well. This ensures that all necessary data points are accessible in one query.  - **Filter by County**: In the `frpm` table, the `County Name` is 'Los Angeles'. So I'll add a condition to filter where `County Name` equals 'Los Angeles'.  - **Set Range for Test Takers**: The `NumTstTakr` should be between 2,000 and 3,000. I'll use a WHERE clause with `BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000` on the `NumTstTakr` column from `satscores`.  - **Retrieve Website**: Finally, select the `Website` column from the `schools` table.  Potential issues to consider:  - **Data Types**: Ensure that `NumTstTakr` is an integer, which it is according to the schema. So using numerical values in the WHERE clause should be fine.  - **Joins and Aliases**: Since all tables are connected via `CDSCode`, I can use INNER JOINs without issues. Using aliases might make the query cleaner but isn't necessary unless needed for clarity.  Putting it all together, the SQL query will join the three tables on their respective keys, filter by Los Angeles County, set the test taker range, and return the website URLs. </think>  SELECT T2.Website FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode INNER JOIN satscores AS T3 ON T1.CDSCode = T3.cds WHERE T1.`County Name` = 'Los Angeles' AND T3.NumTstTakr BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "What is the average number of test takers from Fresno schools that opened between 1/1/1980 and 12/31/1980?"   Let me break this down step by step.  First, I know that the data is spread across three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The question is about Fresno schools, so I should probably start with the schools table to get information about which schools are in Fresno and when they opened.  Looking at the schools table, the 'County' field likely indicates the county name. Since we're interested in Fresno schools, I need to filter where County = 'Fresno'.   Next, the question specifies schools that opened between 1/1/1980 and 12/31/1980. The schools table has an 'OpenDate' field of type DATE. So, I can use a WHERE clause to select records where OpenDate is within that range.  Now, for each school that meets these criteria, I need to find the number of test takers. Test taker data is in the satscores table under 'NumTstTakr'. Each entry in satscores has a 'cds' field which is the primary key and also a foreign key referencing the schools' CDSCode.  So, I'll need to join the schools table with the satscores table on their respective keys. Since both have CDSCode/cds as identifiers, I can use an INNER JOIN or just specify the join condition in the FROM clause with a comma, which is acceptable in SQL for simple joins.  Once joined, I can aggregate the data by school (using GROUP BY) to calculate the average number of test takers per school. The AVG() function will help here, applied to 'NumTstTakr'.  Putting it all together:  1. Select from both schools and satscores tables. 2. Join on CDSCode = cds. 3. Filter for County = 'Fresno' and OpenDate in 1980. 4. Group by school name or some identifier, but since each row is per school, maybe just group by the school's name to get one average per school. 5. Compute the average of NumTstTakr.  Wait, actually, each school might have multiple entries in satscores for different years or types (rtype), so if I want the total test takers across all such entries for a single school in 1980, I should sum them and then take an average? Or maybe just average directly. Hmm, but the question says "average number of test takers," which suggests per school.  So the final SQL would involve selecting s.NumTstTakr, joining schools and satscores on CDSCode/cds, filtering county = 'Fresno' and opendate in 1980, group by school name or cdscode, and then average s.NumTstTakr.   Wait, but if I just want the average across all qualifying schools, maybe I don't need to group by each school. Let me think: The question is asking for the average number of test takers per school that opened in 1980 in Fresno. So, yes, I should calculate the average per school and then take an overall average.  Wait no, actually, perhaps it's simpler: Each school has one entry (if they have data), so AVG(s.NumTstTakr) across all such schools would give the average number of test takers per school in that group. Alternatively, sum all test takers and divide by the number of schools, but SQL can handle it with the AVG function.  So the final query should be:  SELECT AVG(s.NumTstTakr) FROM schools s JOIN satscores sa ON s.CDSCode = sa.cds WHERE s.County = 'Fresno' AND s.OpenDate BETWEEN '1980-01-01' AND '1980-12-31';  Wait, but I'm using FROM with two tables. Wait no, in the query above, it's better to specify both tables and join them properly.  Actually, in SQL, you can list multiple tables in the FROM clause and specify the join condition, like:  SELECT AVG(sa.NumTstTakr) FROM schools s, satscores sa WHERE s.CDSCode = sa.cds   AND s.County = 'Fresno'   AND s.OpenDate BETWEEN '1980-01-01' AND '1980-12-31';  This way, it's an inner join based on the condition. So I think this should work.  I also need to make sure that the dates are correctly formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The OpenDate is a DATE type, so using '1980-01-01' and '1980-12-31' should be correct.  So, putting it all together without any comments, the SQL query would select the average of NumTstTakr from satscores where the school is in Fresno and opened in 1980. </think>  SELECT AVG(sa.NumTstTakr) FROM schools s, satscores sa WHERE s.CDSCode = sa.cds AND s.County = 'Fresno' AND s.OpenDate BETWEEN '1980-01-01' AND '1980-12-31';
SELECT s.Phone FROM schools s JOIN satscores sa ON s.CDSCode = sa.cds WHERE s.District = 'Fresno Unified' AND sa.AvgScrRead IS NOT NULL ORDER BY sa.AvgScrRead ASC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT      s.School AS SchoolName,     s.County AS CountyName,     ss.AvgScrRead AS AverageReadingScore FROM (     SELECT          s.CDSCode,         s.School,         s.County,         ss.AvgScrRead,         RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.County ORDER BY ss.AvgScrRead DESC) AS RankWithinCounty     FROM schools s     JOIN satscores ss ON s.CDSCode = ss.cds     WHERE s.Virtual = 'F' AND ss.AvgScrRead IS NOT NULL ) AS Subquery WHERE RankWithinCounty <= 5; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "What is the type of education offered in the school who scored the highest average in Math?"   First, let me break down what's being asked here. The user wants to know the educational option type (I think that's what they mean by 'type of education offered') of the school that has the highest average math score.  Looking at the database schema provided, there are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools.   The satscores table seems relevant because it contains columns related to SAT scores, including AvgScrMath which is the average math score. So I'll probably need to use this table to find the highest average.  But wait, the question also asks about the educational option type of that school. The frpm table has a column called 'Educational Option Type', so I think I'll have to join these two tables somehow.   The schools table has other information about the schools, but since we're focusing on SAT scores and educational type, maybe it's not directly needed unless there's a need for more joins.  Now, the satscores table has 'cds' as its primary key, which is the CDSCode. The frpm table also uses CDSCode as its primary key. So I can join these two tables on their CDSCode columns.  The plan is to:  1. Find the school with the highest average math score from satscores. 2. Get that school's CDSCode. 3. Use that CDSCode to find the Educational Option Type in frpm. 4. Return that type.  But wait, how do I get the maximum value? I think using MAX(AvgScrMath) would give me the highest average score. Once I have that score, I can then find which school(s) have that score and extract their educational option type.  Wait, but sometimes there might be multiple schools with the same highest score. The question says "the school", implying a singular answer, so maybe we just take any one of them or perhaps the first one. But for now, let's assume there's only one.  So, step by step:  - In satscores, find the maximum AvgScrMath. - Then select all rows where AvgScrMath equals that max value. - For each of those rows, get their cds (CDSCode). - Join with frpm on CDSCode to get Educational Option Type. - Finally, return the Educational Option Type.  But how do I write this in SQL? Maybe a subquery. Let's see:  First, select the maximum AvgScrMath from satscores. Then, select all rows where AvgScrMath equals that max. From those, get their cds codes. Then join with frpm on CDSCode to get Educational Option Type.  Alternatively, I can write it in one query using a subquery to find the max and then filter by that value.  Wait, but if there are multiple schools with the same highest score, this would return all of them. But perhaps the user expects just one answer, so maybe we need to limit it or take any.  Now, putting it together:  SELECT T1.`Educational Option Type` FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN satscores AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.cds WHERE T2.AvgScrMath = (SELECT MAX(AvgScrMath) FROM satscores);  Wait, but some AvgScrMath could be NULL. I need to make sure that the subquery doesn't return NULL. Maybe add a check for non-NULL values.  Alternatively, in the satscores table, if all AvgScrMath are NULL, then this would cause an issue. So perhaps the subquery should exclude NULLs or handle them appropriately.  Wait, looking at the schema, AvgScrMath is INTEGER and can be NULL. So when calculating MAX(AvgScrMath), it will ignore NULLs. But what if all are NULL? Then the max would be NULL, which might cause no rows to return. So maybe I should ensure that we're only considering non-NULL values.  So perhaps in the subquery, select MAX(AvgScrMath) where AvgScrMath is not NULL.  Wait, but the query will still work because if all are NULL, then the subquery returns NULL, and the WHERE clause would be T2.AvgScrMath = NULL, which doesn't match anything since you can't compare with NULL using '='. So to avoid that, perhaps we should handle it by ensuring there's at least one non-NULL value.  But maybe in this case, the data has at least one school with a valid AvgScrMath score. So I'll proceed under that assumption.  So, the SQL would be:  SELECT T1.`Educational Option Type`  FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN satscores AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.cds WHERE T2.AvgScrMath = (SELECT MAX(AvgScrMath) FROM satscores);  Wait, but if there are multiple schools with the same highest AvgScrMath, this would return all of their Educational Option Types. So maybe we should add a LIMIT 1 to get just one.  Alternatively, perhaps it's better to first find the max score, then find the school(s) that have that score, and pick any one (maybe the first).  So adding a LIMIT at the end:  SELECT T1.`Educational Option Type`  FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN satscores AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.cds WHERE T2.AvgScrMath = (SELECT MAX(AvgScrMath) FROM satscores) LIMIT 1;  But wait, the question is about the type of education offered by the school with the highest average. It's possible that multiple schools have the same max score but different educational types. But perhaps the user expects all such types or any one.  Alternatively, maybe we should group them and get a list, but the question seems to ask for the type, so probably just one value is expected.  Thus, I think the SQL with LIMIT 1 would suffice. </think>  SELECT T1.`Educational Option Type` FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN satscores AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.cds WHERE T2.AvgScrMath = (SELECT MAX(AvgScrMath) FROM satscores) LIMIT 1;

SELECT s.MailStreet, s.School  FROM schools s  INNER JOIN satscores sa ON s.CDSCode = sa.cds  WHERE sa.AvgScrRead IS NOT NULL  ORDER BY sa.AvgScrRead ASC  LIMIT 1; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "What is the total number of schools whose total SAT scores are greater or equal to 1500 whose mailing city is Lakeport?"   First, let's break down the problem. The user wants the count of schools where two conditions are met. The first condition is about the SAT scores being at least 1500, and the second is that the school's mailing city is Lakeport.  I know that there are three tables involved: frpm, satscores, and schools. Each has a CDSCode as the primary key, which means I can join them using this code.  The total SAT score isn't directly provided in the satscores table; it's computed by adding AvgScrRead, AvgScrMath, and AvgScrWrite. So, I'll need to calculate that sum in the query. Also, there's a NumGE1500 field which might represent the number of students scoring 1500 or above, but the question is about the total score being >=1500, not the count of students. So, maybe I should focus on calculating the average scores instead.  Wait, no—AvgScrRead, AvgScrMath, and AvgScrWrite are averages per subject. To get the total SAT score, each student's total would be the sum of these three. But since we have the average for each school, adding them would give the average total per student. However, the question is about whether the school's total SAT scores (perhaps in aggregate) meet or exceed 1500. Hmm, that part might need clarification.  Wait, perhaps it's considering each student's total score being >=1500, but the user says "total SAT scores are greater or equal to 1500." Alternatively, they might be referring to the sum of all students' scores across the three sections. But I think the more logical approach is that for a school, if the average total (sum of AvgScrRead + AvgScrMath + AvgScrWrite) is >=1500, then it meets the condition.  So, the steps are:  1. Join the satscores and schools tables on CDSCode because we need data from both. 2. Filter where the mailing city in schools is 'Lakeport'. 3. Calculate the total SAT score per school by adding AvgScrRead + AvgScrMath + AvgScrWrite. 4. Ensure that this sum is >=1500. 5. Count how many such schools exist.  Wait, but looking at the satscores table, there's a field called NumGE1500 which counts the number of test takers with scores >=1500. Maybe that can be used instead of calculating the averages. But the question isn't about the count of students; it's about whether the school's total SAT score meets or exceeds 1500.  Alternatively, perhaps each student's SAT score is the sum of their reading, math, and writing scores, so a school's total would be the sum across all students. But that might not make sense because schools can have varying numbers of students. The question isn't clear on whether it wants per-student average or total.  Wait, the user provided extra knowledge: "Total SAT scores can be computed by AvgScrRead + AvgScrMath + AvgScrWrite." So they want the sum of these three averages to be >=1500.  But wait, the SAT is scored out of 2400 in total (each section up to 800). So a total score per student would range from 600 to 2400. Therefore, for a school's average total SAT score, we calculate AvgScrRead + AvgScrMath + AvgScrWrite and see if that sum is >=1500.  So the condition is:  AvgScrRead + AvgScrMath + AvgScrWrite >= 1500  Now, I need to join satscores with schools because satscores contains the SAT data, and schools contain the mailing city info. So I'll use an INNER JOIN on CDSCode.  Then, I'll select from these joined tables where MailCity is 'Lakeport' and the sum of the three AvgScr fields is >=1500. Finally, count the distinct schools to avoid counting duplicates if a school appears multiple times in satscores for different years or rtypes.  Wait, but satscores has 'rtype', which I think stands for report type, maybe different years or categories. So each CDSCode might have multiple entries. If we want each school counted once regardless of how many times they appear in satscores, we should use COUNT(DISTINCT s.CDSCode).  Putting it all together:  - Join satscores and schools on CDSCode. - Filter where MailCity is 'Lakeport'. - Compute the sum of the three AvgScr fields >=1500. - Count the number of distinct schools meeting these conditions.  So the SQL would look something like this:  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.CDSCode)  FROM satscores sa INNER JOIN schools s ON sa.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE s.MailCity = 'Lakeport' AND (sa.AvgScrRead + sa.AvgScrMath + sa.AvgScrWrite) >= 1500;  I think that's the correct approach. It ensures we're only counting each school once, even if they have multiple entries in satscores. </think>  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.CDSCode) FROM satscores sa INNER JOIN schools s ON sa.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE s.MailCity = 'Lakeport' AND (sa.AvgScrRead + sa.AvgScrMath + sa.AvgScrWrite) >= 1500;
SELECT      s.SchoolName,     SUM(sa.NumTstTakr) AS TotalTestTakers FROM      schools s INNER JOIN      satscores sa ON s.CDSCode = sa.cds WHERE      s.MailCity = 'Fresno' GROUP BY      s.School; 
SELECT School, MailZip FROM schools WHERE (AdmFName1 = 'Avetik' AND AdmLName1 = 'Atoian') OR (AdmFName2 = 'Avetik' AND AdmLName2 = 'Atoian') OR (AdmFName3 = 'Avetik' AND AdmLName3 = 'Atoian'); 
SELECT    COUNT(CASE WHEN County = 'Colusa' AND MailState = 'CA' THEN CDSCode ELSE NULL END) /    COUNT(CASE WHEN County = 'Humboldt' AND MailState = 'CA' THEN CDSCode ELSE NULL END) AS Ratio FROM schools; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query to answer the question: "Of all the schools with a mailing state address in California, how many are active in San Joaquin city?" Let me break this down step by step.  First, I'll look at the database schema provided. There's a table called 'schools' which has several columns. The relevant columns here seem to be:  - StatusType: This probably indicates whether the school is active or not. - MailState: This would tell us the state where the school's mail address is located. - City: This should indicate the city where the school is located.  The question specifies two main criteria: 1. Schools must have a mailing state of California, so MailState = 'CA'. 2. The schools must be active in San Joaquin city. So, I think this means the StatusType is 'Active' and the City is 'San Joaquin'.  Wait, but looking at the schema again, the 'City' column might not necessarily refer to the mailing address's city. There's a 'MailCity' column as well. Hmm, but in the schools table, there are columns like City, MailStreet, MailStrAbr, etc. So I think for the mailing state, we use MailState, but for the physical location, it's just City.  But the question is about schools where their mailing address is in California and they're active in San Joaquin city. So perhaps 'City' refers to where they are located physically, so that should be 'San Joaquin'.  So the conditions would be: - MailState = 'CA' - StatusType = 'Active' - City = 'San Joaquin'  I need to count how many schools meet these criteria.  Now, considering SQL syntax. I'll select from the 'schools' table where these three conditions are met and then count the number of rows.  So the SQL query would be:  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE StatusType = 'Active' AND MailState = 'CA' AND City = 'San Joaquin';  I should make sure that the column names match exactly as in the schema. For example, 'StatusType', 'MailState', and 'City' are all correct.  Wait, does San Joaquin have any case sensitivity issues? Probably not, but just to be safe, I'll use it exactly as given.  Also, since we're counting, using COUNT(*) is appropriate here. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE StatusType = 'Active' AND MailState = 'CA' AND City = 'San Joaquin';
SELECT Phone, Ext FROM (     SELECT s.Phone, s.Ext, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY sc.AvgScrWrite DESC) AS RowNum     FROM schools s     JOIN satscores sc ON s.CDSCode = sc.cds ) WHERE RowNum = 333; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.  The question is: "What is the phone number and extension number for the school with the zip code 95203-3704? Indicate the school's name."   Alright, so I need to extract three pieces of information: Phone number, extension, and school name. The condition here is that the school has a specific zip code, which is 95203-3704.  Now, looking at the database schema provided, there are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. Since we're dealing with phone numbers and zip codes, I should check where those fields are located.   In the 'schools' table, I see columns like Phone (under the 'Phone' field) and Ext (probably short for Extension). The zip code is stored in the 'Zip' column of the same table. Also, the school name is in the 'School' column.  So, the query needs to select these three fields: Phone, Ext, and School from the schools table where Zip equals '95203-3704'.  I should make sure that the WHERE clause correctly filters for the exact zip code provided. Since SQL might be case-sensitive depending on the database, I need to ensure the value is exactly as stored. Also, since it's a string, it needs to be enclosed in quotes.  Putting it all together, the SQL query will select Phone, Ext, and School from schools where Zip is '95203-3704'.   I don't think any JOINs are necessary here because all required fields are in the same table. So, the query should be straightforward. </think>  SELECT `Phone`, `Ext`, `School` FROM `schools` WHERE `Zip` = '95203-3704'
SELECT `Website` FROM `schools` WHERE (`AdmFName1` = 'Mike' AND `AdmLName1` = 'Larson')    OR (`AdmFName2` = 'Mike' AND `AdmLName2` = 'Larson')    OR (`AdmFName3` = 'Mike' AND `AdmLName3` = 'Larson')    OR (`AdmFName1` = 'Dante' AND `AdmLName1` = 'Alvarez')    OR (`AdmFName2` = 'Dante' AND `AdmLName2` = 'Alvarez')    OR (`AdmFName3` = 'Dante' AND `AdmLName3` = 'Alvarez'); 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for the websites of all partially virtual chartered schools located in San Joaquin.  First, let me understand the database schema provided. There are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. From the context, it seems the relevant information needed here is in the 'schools' table because it contains fields like 'Website', 'Charter', 'Virtual', and 'County'.  The user mentioned that "partially virtual" corresponds to Virtual = 'P'. So I need to filter where Virtual equals 'P'. Also, they referred to Charter schools as having Charter = 1 in the schools table. Therefore, I should include a condition where Charter is 1.  Additionally, the schools must be located in San Joaquin County. Looking at the schools table, there's a field named 'County', so I can use that to filter by 'San Joaquin'.  The goal is to retrieve the websites of these schools, which means selecting the 'Website' column from the schools table.  Putting it all together, I need to select Website from schools where: - Virtual = 'P' - Charter = 1 - County = 'San Joaquin'  I should structure this into a SELECT statement with the appropriate WHERE conditions. Also, since the user wants only the SQL without comments, I'll make sure not to include any extra explanations in the query.  So, the final SQL query would select the Website from schools where all three conditions are met. </think>  SELECT `Website` FROM `schools` WHERE `Virtual` = 'P' AND `Charter` = 1 AND `County` = 'San Joaquin';
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM schools  WHERE City = 'Hickman' AND Charter = 1 AND DOC = '52'; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM frpm JOIN schools ON frpm.CDSCode = schools.CDSCode WHERE schools.Charter = 0 AND frpm.`County Name` = 'Los Angeles' AND `Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)` < 0.18; 
<think> Alright, let's break down how I approached solving this SQL query problem.  First, I read the user's question carefully. They want the names of all administrators in chartered schools with a specific charter number, 00D2. Additionally, they need the school name and the city associated with each school.  I started by identifying the relevant tables. The 'schools' table contains information about each school, including whether it's chartered (Charter column), the charter number (CharterNum), the school name (School), and the city (City). It also has administrator details like first and last names and emails for up to three administrators.  Since the question is about chartered schools, I knew I needed to filter where Charter = 1 and CharterNum = '00D2'.   Next, I considered how to get all administrators. Each administrator has a first name (AdmFName1, AdmFName2, AdmFName3) and last name (AdmLName1, etc.) for up to three admins per school. I decided to concatenate these into full names using the || operator in SQL.  I structured the SELECT statement to include the school's name, city, and each administrator's full name. Each admin's first and last names are concatenated, so Admin1 would be AdmFName1 || ' ' || AdmLName1, and similarly for Admin2 and Admin3.  I made sure to use DISTINCT to avoid duplicate entries, especially if a school has multiple admins but the same details might repeat across rows.   The FROM clause specifies the 'schools' table since that's where all needed data resides. The WHERE clause applies the necessary filters: Charter must be 1 (chartered) and CharterNum equals '00D2'.  I double-checked to ensure I didn't miss any columns, especially since some fields like AdmFName3 or AdmLName3 might be NULL if a school has fewer than three admins. But including them as separate columns ensures all possible admins are listed.  Finally, I formatted the SQL without comments, as per the user's request, making sure it's clean and correctly structured. </think>  SELECT DISTINCT School, City, AdmFName1 || ' ' || AdmLName1 AS Admin1, AdmFName2 || ' ' || AdmLName2 AS Admin2, AdmFName3 || ' ' || AdmLName3 AS Admin3 FROM schools WHERE Charter = 1 AND CharterNum = '00D2'
<think> Alright, let's tackle this SQL problem step by step. The user is asking for the total number of schools that have a mailing city in Hickman and belong to charter number 00D4.   First, I need to identify which table contains the necessary information. Looking at the provided database schema, the `schools` table has columns like `MailCity`, `CharterNum`, and others related to school details.  Next, I should consider the conditions: 1. Mailing city is Hickman: This translates to `MailCity = 'Hickman'`. 2. Charter number is 00D4: So, `CharterNum = '00D4'`.  I need to count the number of rows in the `schools` table that meet both these conditions. Using the `COUNT(*)` function makes sense here because it counts all rows that satisfy the WHERE clause.  Putting it all together, I'll write a SELECT statement with COUNT(*), specify the table as `schools`, and set up the WHERE clause with both conditions combined using AND to ensure both are met.  I should also make sure that the column names match exactly what's in the table. For instance, `MailCity` is the correct column name for mailing city, and `CharterNum` holds the charter numbers.  So, the final SQL query will select the count of all records where MailCity is 'Hickman' and CharterNum is '00D4'. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE MailCity = 'Hickman' AND CharterNum = '00D4';
SELECT      (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE County = 'Santa Clara' AND FundingType = 'Local') /      (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE County = 'Santa Clara' AND FundingType IS NOT NULL) * 100; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools  WHERE FundingType = 'Directly Funded'  AND County = 'Stanislaus'  AND OpenDate BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2005-12-31'; 
<think> Alright, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for the total number of Community College District closures in San Francisco in 1989.  First, I'll look at the database schema provided. There are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The relevant information here seems to be in the schools table because it contains details about when a school was closed, which is stored in the ClosedDate column.  I need to extract data where the city is San Francisco. In the schools table, there's a 'City' field that I can use for this condition. Also, since we're looking specifically at Community College Districts, I should filter by the district type. However, checking the schema, I don't see a direct column indicating it's a community college. But considering typical structures, maybe the 'District Name' or another field could help. Alternatively, perhaps knowing that community colleges might have specific names or codes.  Wait, actually, in the schools table, there's a 'StatusType', but that might not directly indicate it's a community college. Maybe I need to look elsewhere. Wait, perhaps the 'School Type' in the frpm table could help, but since the ClosureDate is only in the schools table, maybe I should focus there.  Hmm, perhaps for this question, we can assume that Community College Districts are a specific type of district. So, maybe the 'District Name' includes "Community". Alternatively, if not, maybe it's based on some code or another field. But without explicit data, I might have to make an assumption here.  Wait, the user provided extra knowledge earlier, but in this case, perhaps the key is that the school is a community college district. So, perhaps looking for 'Community College' in the name or type.  But since the database schema doesn't explicitly have a column indicating whether it's a community college, I might need to infer based on other fields. Alternatively, maybe the 'District Name' includes "Community College District" as part of its naming convention.  So, perhaps I can filter where the District Name includes such terms. But without knowing the exact data, this could be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps there's another way, but given the info provided, let me proceed with what I have.  So, to get the count of closures in 1989 in San Francisco, I need to:  1. Filter schools where City = 'San Francisco'. 2. Check if they are Community College Districts. Maybe by checking if the District Name includes "Community College". 3. Extract ClosedDate and ensure it's within the year 1989. 4. Count how many such entries exist.  Wait, but looking at the schools table, the 'ClosedDate' is a DATE type. So I can use a WHERE clause to check if YEAR(ClosedDate) = 1989.  Also, since we're dealing with districts, perhaps we should group by district or ensure that each closure represents a unique district closure. But the question asks for the total amount of closures, so maybe it's just a count of rows meeting the criteria.  Putting this together, the SQL query would select from the schools table where:  - City is 'San Francisco' - District Name includes "Community College" (assuming that's how they are named) - ClosedDate falls within 1989  So I'll write something like SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE City = 'San Francisco' AND District LIKE '%Community%College%' AND STRFTIME('%Y', ClosedDate) = '1989';  Wait, but in SQL, the exact date functions can vary. For SQLite, it's strftime('%Y', ClosedDate). Also, to count each district closure once, perhaps we should use COUNT(DISTINCT District), but maybe just COUNT(*) is sufficient if each row represents a school.  But considering that each CDSCode is unique per school, so each closure would be one row. So using COUNT(*) is correct.  Wait, but the question is about Community College Districts, which are districts, not schools. Each district may have multiple schools. So perhaps I should group by District and count how many districts closed in that year. Hmm, that complicates it a bit because each school closure doesn't necessarily mean the entire district closed.  Alternatively, maybe the user considers each school closure as part of the district's closure. But without more context, it's hard to say. Given the schema, perhaps each row is per school, so if multiple schools in the same district closed in 1989, each would count individually. But the question asks for the total amount of Community College District closures, which implies per district.  Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check: The user's question is about the number of closures, not the number of districts. So maybe it's just a count of schools in San Francisco that are community colleges and closed in 1989.  Alternatively, if each closure is at the district level, then multiple schools could be part of one district closure, but without data on that, perhaps it's better to proceed with school-level counts.  So, the SQL query would be:  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools  WHERE City = 'San Francisco'  AND District LIKE '%Community College%'  AND STRFTIME('%Y', ClosedDate) = '1989';  But I'm not sure if District Name includes "Community College" exactly. Maybe it's better to use a more general approach, perhaps using LIKE with wildcards.  Alternatively, maybe Community Colleges have a specific StatusType or another field. But without that info, I have to make an assumption.  So, the final SQL is as above. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE City = 'San Francisco' AND District LIKE '%Community%College%' AND strftime('%Y', ClosedDate) = '1989';
SELECT County, COUNT(ClosedDate) AS ClosureCount  FROM schools  WHERE SOC = '11' AND ClosedDate BETWEEN '1980-01-01' AND '1989-12-31' GROUP BY County ORDER BY ClosureCount DESC; 
<think> Alright, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me break down what they're asking for.  First, the user wants the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) school district identification number for all schools that have a School Ownership Code (SOC) and are part of State Special Schools. From the extra knowledge provided, I know that State Special Schools correspond to SOC = 31.  Looking at the database schema, the relevant table here is `schools` because it contains both the NCES district ID (`NCESDist`) and the SOC fields (`SOC` and `SOCType`). The other tables, `frpm` and `satscores`, don't seem directly related to this query since they focus on meal programs and test scores respectively.  I need to select the `NCESDist` from the `schools` table where two conditions are met: SOC is not null (since the school has a School Ownership Code) and SOCType equals 31, which indicates State Special Schools.   So, the SQL query will be a SELECT statement targeting `NCESDist`, with a WHERE clause that checks both conditions. I should make sure to handle cases where SOC might be null by explicitly checking that it's not null.  Putting it all together, the query selects `NCESDist` from `schools` where `SOC` is not null and `SOCType` equals '31'. </think>  SELECT NCESDist FROM schools WHERE SOC IS NOT NULL AND SOCType = 31
SELECT s.StatusType, COUNT(*)  FROM frpm f INNER JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE f.`County Name` = 'Alpine' AND f.`School Type` = 'District Community Day' GROUP BY s.StatusType; 
SELECT T1.`District Code` FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode WHERE T2.Magnet = 0 AND T2.City = 'Fresno'; 
SELECT frpm.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` FROM frpm JOIN schools ON frpm.CDSCode = schools.CDSCode WHERE schools.EdOpsCode = 'SSS'   AND schools.County = 'Fremont'   AND frpm.`Academic Year` = '2014-2015'; 
SELECT f.`Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` FROM frpm f JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE s.School = 'Youth Authority School' AND s.MailStreet = 'PO Box 1040'; 
<think> Alright, so I've got this SQL problem to solve. The user wants me to find the lowest grade for a specific school. Let's break it down step by step.  First, understanding the question: "What is the lowest grade for the District Special Education Consortia School with NCES district ID 0613360?" From the extra knowledge, I know that 'District Special Education Consortia School' corresponds to EdOpsCode = 'SPECON'.  Looking at the database schema, there are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The relevant info is in the schools table because it contains the NCESDist (which I assume is the NCES district ID) and EdOpsCode.  So, my goal is to query the 'Low Grade' from the frpm table where the school meets two conditions: NCESDist is 0613360 and EdOpsCode is SPECON. But wait, how do these tables link? The schools table's primary key is CDSCode, which is also in frpm as a foreign key. So I'll need to join schools and frpm on CDSCode.  I should select 'Low Grade' from frpm where the corresponding record in schools has NCESDist = 0613360 and EdOpsCode = 'SPECON'.   Putting it together, I'll write an INNER JOIN between schools and frpm ON their CDSCodes. Then apply the WHERE conditions for NCESDist and EdOpsCode. That should give me the correct row, from which I can extract the Low Grade.  I need to make sure the SQL syntax is correct: using quotes around string literals and ensuring case sensitivity matches if necessary. </think>  SELECT `Low Grade` FROM frpm INNER JOIN schools ON frpm.CDSCode = schools.CDSCode WHERE schools.NCESDist = '0613360' AND schools.EdOpsCode = 'SPECON';
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for the educational level name of schools that have Breakfast Provision 2 in county code 37, and also to indicate the school names.  First, looking at the database schema provided. There are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. Each has different columns.  The user's question mentions "Breakfast Provision 2". I'm not seeing a column that directly says "Breakfast Provision", but in the frpm table, there's a column called "NSLP Provision Status". Maybe this refers to the National School Lunch Program provision status. If Breakfast Provision 2 is related to NSLP, perhaps '2' in this context indicates a specific provision status.  Next, county code 37. In the schools table, there's a column named "County" which is a TEXT type, but wait, looking back at frpm, there's also "County Code". So maybe I need to use the County Code from frpm where it equals '37'.  The question asks for the educational level name and the school names. The schools table has a column called "EdOpsName" which might represent the educational option type as a name. Alternatively, in frpm, there's an "Educational Option Type" column. But since we need the name, perhaps "EdOpsName" from schools is more appropriate.  So I think I should join these tables to get both the school names and their educational level names. The common key between frpm and schools is CDSCode, so I'll use that to join them.  Putting it together: I need to select the School Name (from frpm) and EdOpsName (from schools). The conditions are that NSLP Provision Status in frpm is '2' and County Code is '37'. So the WHERE clause will filter on these two conditions, and then INNER JOIN the frpm and schools tables on CDSCode.  I should make sure to only include rows where both conditions are met. Also, since the user didn't specify any ordering or limits, I don't need to add those unless necessary.  So the SQL would select School Name and EdOpsName from frpm inner joined with schools on CDSCode, where NSLP Provision Status is 2 and County Code is 37. </think>  SELECT T1.`School Name`, T2.`EdOpsName` FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode WHERE T1.`NSLP Provision Status` = '2' AND T1.`County Code` = '37';
<think> Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the SQL query for the given question.  First, understanding the user's question is crucial. They're asking for the city location of a high school in Merced County that has specific grade levels and lunch provision status. The key points are:  1. **High School**: Indicated by EILCode = 'HS'. 2. **Lunch Provision 2**: This translates to NSLPProvisionStatus = 2. 3. **Grade Levels**: Low Grade is 9, High Grade is 12. 4. **County**: Merced, so County Name should be 'Merced'.  Next, I need to identify which table holds the necessary information. The `frpm` table contains details about lunch provisions (NSLPProvisionStatus) and grade levels (Low Grade, High Grade). It also has County Name.  Since the question is about a high school, I check if EILCode is in the `frpm` table. Looking at the schema, EILCode isn't directly in `frpm`, but it's present in `schools`. However, since the user provided extra knowledge that EILCode = 'HS' represents high schools, and considering the foreign keys, I can join `frpm` with `schools` using CDSCode.  Wait, actually, upon closer inspection, the `frpm` table doesn't have EILCode. So to filter for high schools, I need to join `frpm` with `schools` on CDSCode and then apply the EILCode condition from the `schools` table.  So the steps are:  - Join `frpm` and `schools` on CDSCode. - Filter where:   - County Name is 'Merced'.   - Low Grade = '9'.   - High Grade = '12'.   - NSLPProvisionStatus = 2.   - EILCode = 'HS'.  The desired output is the city location, which comes from the `City` field in `schools`.  Putting it all together, I write an INNER JOIN between the two tables and apply all the WHERE conditions. Finally, select the City from `schools`. </think>  SELECT T2.City FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode WHERE T1.CountyName = 'Merced' AND T1.LowGrade = '9' AND T1.HighGrade = '12' AND T1.NSLPProvisionStatus = 2 AND T2.EILCode = 'HS'
SELECT s.SchoolName,         ROUND(100 * f.`FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` / f.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`, 2) AS PercentEligibleFRPM FROM frpm f JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE f.`Low Grade` = 'K'   AND f.`High Grade` = '09'   AND f.`County Name` = 'Los Angeles'; 
SELECT Low_Grade, High_Grade, COUNT(*) as CountOfGradeSpan FROM frpm JOIN schools ON frpm.CDSCode = schools.CDSCode WHERE schools.City = 'Adelanto' GROUP BY Low_Grade, High_Grade ORDER BY CountOfGradeSpan DESC; 
SELECT County, COUNT(*) as num_virtual_schools  FROM schools  WHERE Virtual = 'F' AND (County = 'San Diego' OR County = 'Santa Barbara')  GROUP BY County; 
SELECT f.`School Type`, s.School, s.Latitude  FROM frpm f  INNER JOIN schools s  ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode  ORDER BY s.Latitude DESC  LIMIT 1; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me break down what they're asking for.  The user wants to find the city where a school in California has the lowest latitude. They also want the school's name and its lowest grade. So, first, I should identify which tables contain the necessary information.  Looking at the database schema, there are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The 'schools' table seems to have the location details like city and state, as well as latitude. It also has a field for 'Low Grade', which is what we need. The other tables don't seem relevant here since they focus on meal programs and test scores.  So, I'll focus on the 'schools' table. My goal is to find the school in California (state = 'CA') with the minimum latitude. Once I have that record, I can extract the city, school name, and low grade.  I should use a SELECT statement with the MIN function on Latitude where State is 'CA'. But since I also need other fields like City, School, and Low Grade, I'll select those as well. To get just one row (the school with the lowest latitude), I'll limit the results to 1.  Wait, I should check if all these columns are available in the schools table. Latitude is there as a REAL, City as TEXT, School name under 'School', and Low Grade—actually, looking again, I don't see a 'Low Grade' field in the schools table. Oh no, that's a problem.  Wait, maybe it's in another table? Let me check the frpm table. Yes, there's a 'Low Grade' column in frpm. So I'll need to join the schools and frpm tables on CDSCode since both have that as a primary key.  So now my query needs to join schools and frpm where State is 'CA'. Then find the minimum latitude from that joined set. Select City, School Name, and Low Grade.  I think using an INNER JOIN would work here because I only want rows where both tables have matching CDSCode records.  Putting it all together: select City, School, LowGrade from schools inner join frpm on CDSCode where State is 'CA', order by Latitude ascending to get the lowest one first, and limit to 1 result.  I should make sure that the columns are correctly named. In schools, the school name is under 'School' column, and in frpm, it's 'Low Grade'. So I'll alias them appropriately for clarity.  Hmm, wait, do I need any aggregations or groupings? Since I'm just looking for a single record with the minimum latitude, ordering by Latitude ASC and limiting to 1 should suffice without needing MIN().  So the final SQL would join both tables on CDSCode, filter where State is CA, order by Latitude, and return the needed fields. I think that's correct. </think>  SELECT s.City AS City, s.School AS SchoolName, f.`Low Grade` AS LowGrade FROM schools s INNER JOIN frpm f ON s.CDSCode = f.CDSCode WHERE s.State = 'CA' ORDER BY s.Latitude ASC LIMIT 1
SELECT `Low Grade`, `High Grade` FROM frpm WHERE CDSCode = (SELECT CDSCode FROM schools ORDER BY ABS(Longitude) DESC LIMIT 1); 
WITH k8_magnet_cities AS (   SELECT s.City, f.Educational Option Type    FROM frpm f   INNER JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode   WHERE f.Magnet = 1 AND f.Low Grade = 'K' AND f.High Grade = '8' ) SELECT COUNT(*) as total_k8_magnet_schools, City, COUNT(City) as number_of_schools_in_city FROM k8_magnet_cities GROUP BY City;

<think> Alright, let me try to figure out how to write this SQL query step by step.  So the user is asking for the "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)" in schools administered by an administrator whose first name is Alusine. They also want the district code of those schools.  First, I need to understand where each piece of information comes from. The percentage they're asking about seems to be a calculated value based on two columns: "Free Meal Count (K-12)" divided by "Enrollment (K-12)" multiplied by 100. So that calculation will be part of the SELECT statement.  Looking at the database schema, I see three relevant tables: frpm, schools, and satscores. Since we're dealing with administrator names, which are in the 'schools' table under AdmFName1, AdmFName2, etc., I'll need to join this table with the frpm table where the percentage is stored.  The district code isn't directly available in the schools table as a separate field; instead, it's part of the District Name and such. Wait, actually, looking back at the 'frpm' table, there's a "District Code" column which is an integer. So I can get the district code from frpm.  So, I'll need to join the schools table with frpm on CDSCode because that's the common key. That way, I can access both the administrator's name and the necessary data for the percentage calculation.  Now, the condition is that the first name of an administrator is Alusine. Since there are multiple admin fields (AdmFName1, AdmFName2, AdmFName3), I should check all three in case any of them have the first name Alusine. So I'll use an OR statement in the WHERE clause to cover each possibility.  Putting it together, my SELECT will calculate the percentage as (FreeMealCount / Enrollment) * 100 and alias it appropriately. I'll select the District Code from frpm. Then, I'll join schools and frpm on CDSCode. The WHERE clause will check if any of AdmFName1, AdmFName2, or AdmFName3 is 'Alusine'.  I should also make sure that Enrollment (K-12) isn't zero to avoid division by zero errors, but the user didn't specify handling that, so maybe it's beyond this query's scope.  So the final SQL would select the calculated percentage and district code where any admin's first name is Alusine. </think>  SELECT CAST((T1.`Free Meal Count (K-12)` / T1.`Enrollment (K-12)`) * 100 AS REAL) AS "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)", T1.`District Code` FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode WHERE T2.AdmFName1 = 'Alusine' OR T2.AdmFName2 = 'Alusine' OR T2.AdmFName3 = 'Alusine';
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for the administrator's last name who oversees a school with Charter number 40. Additionally, they want the district, county, and school name.  First, looking at the database schema provided, there are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. Since we're dealing with charter numbers and administrative details, I'll focus on the 'schools' table because it contains fields like 'CharterNum', which should hold the number 40 in this case.  The 'schools' table has several fields related to administrators' contact information. Specifically, there are multiple admin fields: AdmFName1, AdmLName1, AdmEmail1, and so on up to AdmFName3, etc. Since the question is about the last name of an administrator overseeing the school, I'll need to retrieve AdmLName from one of these admin entries.  Now, how do I know which admin entry to use? The user didn't specify whether it's the first, second, or third admin. In many cases, the primary contact might be Adm1. So, I'll assume that AdmLName1 corresponds to the administrator in charge.  Next, I need to join this information with other details like district and county names. The 'schools' table already contains 'District' and 'County' fields, so those can be directly selected. The school name is also available as the 'School' field.  Putting it all together, the SQL query should select AdmLName1 (administrator's last name), District, County, and School from the schools table where CharterNum is 40.  I need to make sure that I correctly reference the fields. In the schema, 'CharterNum' is a TEXT field, so when comparing it to 40, I should use quotes around the number if necessary, but since it's text, it might be stored as a string. However, looking at the example response, they used CharterNum = '40', which should correctly match.  So, the SQL query will be selecting these four fields from the schools table with the condition that CharterNum equals '40'. </think>  SELECT AdmLName1 AS AdministratorLastname, District, County, School FROM schools WHERE CharterNum = '40'
<think> Alright, I need to help the user by writing an SQL query based on their question. Let me break down what they're asking for and how to approach it.  First, the question is about extracting valid email addresses of school administrators in specific conditions. The schools are located in San Bernardino county, specifically in the "San Bernardino City Unified" city. They opened between 2009 and 2010. Also, the school types should be either Intermediate/Middle Schools or Unified Schools.  From the extra knowledge provided:  - Intermediate/Middle Schools correspond to SOC = '62'. - Unified School corresponds to DOC = '54'. - The opening dates are between 1/1/2009 and 12/31/2010.  I need to look at the database schema. The 'schools' table contains information about each school, including location details (County, District), opening date (OpenDate), SOC code, DOC code, and administrator emails (AdmEmail1, AdmEmail2, AdmEmail3).  So, I'll start by selecting from the schools table where:  - County is 'San Bernardino'. - District is 'San Bernardino City Unified'. Wait, actually, in the schema, there's a 'District' field. But looking back, the user might be referring to both county and city, so maybe the district name is "City of San Bernardino" and the school is part of that district. Hmm, but perhaps I need to check if it's the District or School fields. Wait, in the schema, County, District, and School are separate fields. So 'County' should be 'San Bernardino', and perhaps 'District' is the name of the district, which might be "San Bernardino City Unified". Alternatively, maybe it's stored differently.  Wait, looking at the schools table:  - The County field is TEXT NOT NULL. - District is another field, also TEXT NOT NULL. So to target San Bernardino county, I set County = 'San Bernardino'. For the city, perhaps the district name is "City of San Bernardino" or maybe it's stored as part of the School's info? Wait no, the question says "located in the San Bernardino county, City of San Bernardino City Unified". Hmm, that seems a bit off. Maybe the user meant that the school is in San Bernardino County and within the district named "San Bernardino City Unified"?  Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again:  "administrator of the school located in the San Bernardino county, City of San Bernardino City Unified"  So perhaps it's referring to schools located in both the county and city named "City of San Bernardino", but maybe that's a district name? Or perhaps the County is 'San Bernardino', District is 'City of San Bernardino', and School is part of that.  Wait, looking at the database schema again: The schools table has fields for County, District, and School. So to be in San Bernardino county, set County = 'San Bernardino'. For the district, maybe it's "San Bernardino City Unified". Wait, but the user wrote "City of San Bernardino City Unified", which might be a typo or confusion.  Alternatively, perhaps the 'District' field is "San Bernardino City Unified". So I should set District = 'San Bernardino City Unified'.  Wait, let me think: The question says "located in the San Bernardino county, City of San Bernardino City Unified." That's a bit unclear. Maybe it means the school is located in San Bernardino County and within the district called "City of San Bernardino", but that doesn't make much sense because "San Bernardino City Unified" is a known district name.  Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to say that the schools are located in San Bernardino County and the city is part of the district named "City of San Bernardino". But I'm not sure. For now, I'll proceed by setting County = 'San Bernardino' and District = 'San Bernardino City Unified'.  Next, the school opened between 2009-01-01 and 2010-12-31. So OpenDate >= '2009-01-01' AND OpenDate <= '2010-12-31'.  School types: either Intermediate/Middle Schools (SOC='62') or Unified School (DOC='54'). So the conditions are (SOC = '62' OR DOC = '54').  Wait, but in the schools table, SOC and DOC are separate fields. I think that's correct because:  - SOC is the "type" of school, e.g., 62 for middle schools. - DOC refers to the district organization code; 54 might be for unified school districts.  But wait, according to extra knowledge: Unified School refers to DOC=54, so we need to check if the school's type is either Intermediate (SOC='62') or part of a Unified District (DOC='54'). So combining these with OR.  Putting it all together:  SELECT AdmEmail1, AdmEmail2, AdmEmail3 FROM schools WHERE County = 'San Bernardino' AND District = 'San Bernardino City Unified' AND OpenDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2010-12-31' AND (SOC = '62' OR DOC = '54').  Wait, but the user's question says "City of San Bernardino City Unified". So perhaps I need to adjust District accordingly. Maybe it's actually stored as "San Bernardino City Unified", so District should be that value.  I think that makes sense because "San Bernardino City Unified" is a known school district in California. So, County = 'San Bernardino', District = 'San Bernardino City Unified'.  Wait, but the user wrote "City of San Bernardino City Unified"—that might have been a mistake. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to both county and city as San Bernardino. But perhaps I should just use County and District fields.  So, final SQL: select email columns from schools where County is 'San Bernardino', District is 'San Bernardino City Unified', OpenDate between 2009-2010, and either SOC=62 or DOC=54. </think>  SELECT AdmEmail1, AdmEmail2, AdmEmail3 FROM schools WHERE County = 'San Bernardino' AND District = 'City of San Bernardino' AND (SOC = 62 OR DOC = 54) AND OpenDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2010-12-31';

<think> Okay, I need to figure out how many female customers who were born before 1950 are staying in Sokolov. Let's break this down step by step.  First, the question is asking about clients, so I'll start with the client table. The gender is 'F' for females, so I'll filter on that. Also, their birth year should be before 1950, which means their birth_date needs to be less than '1950-01-01'.   Next, they need to be staying in Sokolov. District names are in the A2 column of the district table. So I have to find the district where A2 is 'Sokolov' and get its district_id.  Now, since each client has a district_id, I can join the client and district tables on that field. But wait, looking at the schema, the client's district_id references the district's district_id, so an INNER JOIN should work there.  I also need to count how many such clients exist. So after joining and filtering, I'll use COUNT(client_id) to get the number.  Putting it all together: Select from client inner join with district where gender is 'F', birth_date < '1950-01-01', and A2 is 'Sokolov'. Then count the clients. </think>  SELECT COUNT(T1.client_id) FROM client AS T1 INNER JOIN district AS T2 ON T1.district_id = T2.district_id WHERE T1.gender = 'F' AND T1.birth_date < '1950-01-01' AND T2.A2 = 'Sokolov'
SELECT account_id FROM trans WHERE date = ( SELECT MIN(date) FROM trans WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', date) = '1995' ) AND STRFTIME('%Y', date) = '1995';

<think> Okay, so I need to find out which client issued their card on '1994/3/3' and get their client ID. Hmm, let's think about how the database is structured.  First, looking at the tables provided, the card table has information about each card, including when it was issued. The card_id is linked to disp_id through the foreign key in the card table. Then, the disp table connects disp_id to client_id through its own foreign keys.  Wait, so the flow would be: from the card issuance date, find the corresponding disp_id, and then use that to get the client_id. But wait, does any card have an issued date of '1994/3/3'? Let me check the data.  Looking at the inserted values in the card table:  - Card 1: issued on '1998-10-16' - Card 2: '1998-03-13' - Card 3: '1995-09-03' - Card 4: '1998-11-26' - Card 5: '1995-04-24'  None of these are on '1994/3/3'. Hmm, that's strange. So there's no card issued on that date in the provided data. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the format. Wait, the dates in the database are in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, so perhaps the question is using a different format, like 'YYYY/MM/DD'.  So the target date is March 3rd, 1994. Let me check again, but as per the data provided, there's no card issued on that exact date. So does that mean the answer is NULL or no client found?  But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the question expects a SQL query regardless of whether such a record exists. So the logic would be: join the card and disp tables to link the issue date to the client_id.  So the steps are:  1. Select from the card table where issued date is '1994-03-03'. 2. For each matching card, get its disp_id. 3. Then, in the disp table, find the corresponding client_id using that disp_id. 4. Finally, retrieve the client_id.  But since there's no such record in the provided data, the query would return nothing. However, the user still wants the SQL statement, so I need to write it correctly regardless of the result.  So the SQL would be:  SELECT T2.client_id FROM card AS T1 INNER JOIN disp AS T2 ON T1.disp_id = T2.disp_id WHERE T1.issue_date = '1994-03-03';  Wait, but looking at the disp table structure, I think it's actually a many-to-many relationship between cards and clients. Wait no, each card has one disp_id, which in turn links to one client.  But wait, looking back, the disp table doesn't have an issue_date field. Oh wait, no, the card table has 'issued' as a date column. So I can directly filter on that.  Wait, the card table's structure is: trans_id, account_id, date, type, etc., but for the card table, it's:  card_id, disp_id, issue_date, ...  Wait, actually, looking at the schema provided earlier:  CREATE TABLE card (     card_id INTEGER,     disp_id INTEGER,     issue_date DATE,     ... );  So yes, the card table has an 'issue_date' field. So the query is correct.  But in the data given, there are no cards issued on 1994-03-03, so the result would be empty. But since the question asks for the SQL, that's what I'll provide. </think>  SELECT T.client_id FROM disp AS T INNER JOIN card AS C ON T.disp_id = C.disp_id WHERE C.issue_date = '1994-03-03'

<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that counts the number of triple bonds in the given database schema. The user mentioned that a triple bond is represented by bond_type '#' and they want me to extract this information.  First, I'll look at the relevant table. From the provided schema, there's a `bond` table with columns: bond_id, molecule_id, and bond_type. Since we're interested in triple bonds, which are indicated by '#', I should focus on this column.  I remember that COUNT(*) is used to count all rows that meet certain conditions, so using it with a WHERE clause makes sense here. The condition would be where bond_type equals '#'.   So, the basic structure of the query would be selecting from the `bond` table and counting the rows where bond_type is '#'. That should give the total number of triple bonds.  I don't think there's any need to join other tables because all necessary information is in the `bond` table. Also, since each bond_id is unique (as it's a primary key), using COUNT(*) won't cause any issues with duplicates or anything else.  Putting it all together, the SQL query should be straightforward: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '#'; </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '#';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM atom WHERE element != 'br'; 
<think> Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to write an SQL query that counts how many of the first 100 molecules (from TR000 to TR099) are carcinogenic. They've provided some extra knowledge: a molecule is carcinogenic if its label is '+'.  First, I need to understand the database schema. There's a 'molecule' table with columns 'molecule_id' and 'label'. The molecule_ids start from TR000 onwards, so the first 100 would be from TR000 up to TR099.  The goal is to count how many entries in this range have a label of '+'. So I'll need to select from the 'molecule' table where molecule_id is between TR000 and TR099. Since the IDs are strings, I can use the LIKE operator with a wildcard to capture all IDs starting with 'TR' followed by two digits (from 00 to 99). Alternatively, using BETWEEN might work since TR000 comes before TR001, etc., but I should check if the ordering is correct.  Wait, actually, string comparison in SQL can sometimes be tricky. For example, does 'TR099' come after 'TR100'? No, because it's a string, so 'TR1' would be less than 'TR10', which isn't what we want. So using LIKE might not accurately capture the first 100 if we go beyond two digits. But in this case, since it's only up to TR099, it's safe.  So I can write a WHERE clause that checks if molecule_id is between 'TR000' and 'TR099'. Alternatively, using LIKE 'TR[0-9][0-9]' would also work, but maybe BETWEEN is clearer here.  Then, within those, count how many have label = '+'.  Putting it all together, the SQL query should select from 'molecule', where molecule_id is between TR000 and TR099 (inclusive), and label is '+'. Then, use COUNT(*) to get the number. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `molecule` WHERE `label` = '+' AND `molecule_id` BETWEEN 'TR000' AND 'TR099';
SELECT DISTINCT molecule_id FROM atom WHERE element = 'c'; 
SELECT DISTINCT a.element  FROM atom a  WHERE a.atom_id IN (     SELECT c.atom_id FROM connected c WHERE c.bond_id = 'TR004_8_9'     UNION      SELECT c.atom_id2 FROM connected c WHERE c.bond_id = 'TR004_8_9' ); 
<think> Okay, let's see what the user is asking for here. They want me to write an SQL query that identifies which elements are involved in a double bond. From the extra knowledge provided, I know that a double bond is indicated by a bond_type of '='.  First, I need to figure out where the relevant information is stored. The bond table has a column called bond_type and another for molecule_id. Each bond connects two atoms, which are stored in the connected table with their respective atom_ids and the corresponding bond_id.  So, my approach should be to join these tables appropriately. I'll start by selecting from the bond table where bond_type is '=' because that's what defines a double bond. Then, I need to find out which atoms are connected via each of those bonds.  The connected table has pairs of atom_ids linked by a bond_id. So for each double bond in the bond table, I can get the two atom_ids from the connected table using the bond_id as a foreign key. Once I have the atom_ids, I can join them with the atom table to get their elements.  Wait, but since each bond connects two atoms, I need to make sure I capture both elements involved in the double bond. That means I'll probably need to use INNER JOINs to link the tables together based on their keys.   I should also consider that each connected entry has two records for each connection (like atom1 to atom2 and vice versa), so I might end up with duplicate entries if I'm not careful. To avoid duplicates, using DISTINCT would be helpful.  Putting it all together: I'll start with the bond table where bond_type is '=', join that with the connected table on bond_id to get both atoms involved, then join each atom_id with the atom table to retrieve their elements. Finally, I'll list out these elements in the output. </think>  SELECT DISTINCT T3.element AS elem1, T4.element AS elem2  FROM bond AS T1  INNER JOIN connected AS T2 ON T1.bond_id = T2.bond_id  INNER JOIN atom AS T3 ON T2.atom_id = T3.atom_id  INNER JOIN atom AS T4 ON T2.atom_id2 = T4.atom_id  WHERE T1.bond_type = '=';
<think> Alright, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking about the type of label that's most numerous in atoms containing hydrogen. Let me break this down step by step.  First, let me understand the schema provided. There are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The relevant ones here seem to be 'atom' and 'molecule'. The 'bond' and 'connected' tables might not be directly needed since the question is about atoms with hydrogen and their corresponding labels.  The 'atom' table has columns: atom_id, molecule_id, element. So each atom belongs to a molecule and has an element type. The 'molecule' table has molecule_id and label. Each molecule has an ID and a label.  The user's question is about finding the most numerous label among atoms that have hydrogen. From the extra knowledge provided, "with hydrogen" translates to where the element is 'h'. So I need to find all atoms where element = 'h', then see which molecule's label appears most frequently among these atoms.  Wait, but each atom in the 'atom' table has a molecule_id, which links to the 'molecule' table. So for each hydrogen atom (element='h'), we can get its molecule's label and count how many times each label occurs across all such atoms.  So the plan is:  1. Select from the 'atom' table where element = 'h'. 2. For each of these atoms, join with the 'molecule' table on molecule_id to get the label. 3. Count the number of occurrences for each label. 4. Find which label has the highest count.  But wait, in SQL, to get the maximum count, we might need to use a subquery or window function. Alternatively, after grouping and counting, we can order by count descending and pick the top one.  Let me outline the steps in SQL:  - Join 'atom' and 'molecule' on molecule_id where element = 'h'. - Group by label. - Count the number of rows for each group. - Find the maximum count among these groups.  But how exactly to implement this? Let's think about the structure.  First, I'll write a subquery that selects the labels along with their counts. Then, in the outer query, I can find which label has the maximum count.  So, something like:  SELECT label FROM (   SELECT m.label, COUNT(a.atom_id) as cnt   FROM atom a   JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id   WHERE a.element = 'h'   GROUP BY m.label ) ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 1;  Wait, but let me test this logic. Suppose two labels have the same max count; which one will it pick? But since we're just looking for the most numerous, any of them is acceptable unless there's a tiebreaker, but the question doesn't specify that.  Alternatively, using window functions to get the maximum:  WITH labeled_counts AS (   SELECT m.label, COUNT(a.atom_id) as cnt,     RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(a.atom_id) DESC) as rank   FROM atom a   JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id   WHERE a.element = 'h'   GROUP BY m.label ) SELECT label FROM labeled_counts WHERE rank = 1;  But the first approach with subquery and LIMIT might be sufficient.  Wait, but looking at the data provided:  In the 'atom' table, let's see which atoms have element='h'. From the INSERT statements:  Looking at the INSERT into atom: TR000_5 has element 'h'. So there's only one hydrogen atom in TR000. The molecule_id for this is 'TR000', and its label is '+'.  So in reality, when we run the query, it should return '+', since that's the only label associated with a hydrogen atom.  But if there were multiple molecules with labels and more hydrogen atoms, then we'd have counts to compare.  In any case, the SQL needs to count how many times each label appears among hydrogen atoms and pick the one with the highest count.  So putting it all together:  The subquery will group by m.label and count the number of atoms where element='h'. Then the outer query selects the label with the maximum count.  I think that's correct. </think>  To determine the most numerous label among atoms containing hydrogen, we need to count each label's occurrences for such atoms and select the one with the highest count. Here's how it's done:  SELECT m.label FROM atom a JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE a.element = 'h' GROUP BY m.label ORDER BY COUNT(a.atom_id) DESC LIMIT 1;
SELECT DISTINCT b.bond_type FROM connected c LEFT JOIN atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id AND a1.element = 'Cl' LEFT JOIN atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id AND a2.element = 'Cl' JOIN bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id WHERE (a1.atom_id IS NOT NULL) OR (a2.atom_id IS NOT NULL); 
SELECT DISTINCT a1.atom_id, a2.atom_id  FROM connected c1  JOIN connected c2 ON c1.bond_id = c2.bond_id  WHERE c1.bond_type = '-' AND c1.atom_id < c2.atom_id; 
SELECT c.atom_id, c.atom_id2  FROM connected c  WHERE c.molecule_id IN (SELECT m.molecule_id FROM molecule m WHERE m.label = '-'); 
SELECT element FROM (   SELECT a.element, COUNT(a.atom_id) as count    FROM atom a   JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id   WHERE m.label = '-'   GROUP BY a.element ) ORDER BY count ASC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT T1.bond_type FROM bond AS T1 INNER JOIN connected AS T2 ON T1.bond_id = T2.bond_id WHERE (T2.atom_id = 'TR004_8' AND T2.atom_id2 = 'TR004_20') OR (T2.atom_id = 'TR004_20' AND T2.atom_id2 = 'TR004_8'); 
SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id NOT IN (   SELECT molecule_id FROM atom WHERE element = 'sn' ) AND label IN ('+', '-') AND label NOT IN (   SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id NOT IN (     SELECT molecule_id FROM atom WHERE element = 'sn'   ) ); 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.atom_id)  FROM atom a JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE a.element IN ('i', 's') AND m.molecule_id NOT IN (   SELECT b1.molecule_id    FROM bond b1    WHERE b1.bond_type != '-' ) 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that identifies all connected atoms with a triple bond based on the provided database schema. Let me start by understanding what each table represents and how they're related.  First, looking at the tables:  1. **atom** table has columns: atom_id (primary key), molecule_id, element. 2. **bond** table has bond_id (primary key), molecule_id, bond_type. 3. **connected** table links atoms through bonds, with atom_id, atom_id2, and bond_id.  The user wants to find all connected atoms that have a triple bond. From the extra knowledge, I know a triple bond is where bond_type = '#'.   So, my goal is to join these tables to get the atom pairs connected by such bonds.  I'll start by considering the **connected** table because it directly links two atoms via a bond_id. Each row in connected represents a connection between two atoms using a specific bond. Since each bond has a type, I can link the connected table to the bond table on bond_id.  Once I have the bond details, I can filter where bond_type is '#'. This will give me all the connections involving triple bonds.  But I also need to get the actual atom IDs involved in these connections. The connected table already has atom_id and atom_id2, so after filtering by bond type, I can select these two columns to see which atoms are connected by a triple bond.  I should consider whether each connection is stored twice (once for each direction) in the connected table. For example, if there's a row with ('A', 'B', 'bond1') and another with ('B', 'A', 'bond1'), I don't want to duplicate the pair. But since the user just wants all connected atoms, including both directions might be necessary unless they specify uniqueness.  However, in this case, it's probably better to include all possible pairs as they appear in the table, even if they're duplicates in different orders. The question doesn't mention eliminating duplicates, so I'll proceed without worrying about that.  Putting it all together:  1. Join **connected** and **bond** on bond_id. 2. Filter where bond_type is '#'. 3. Select atom_id and atom_id2 from the connected table for these filtered rows.  I don't think I need to involve the molecule or atom tables since the question only asks about the connected atoms, not their elements or which molecules they belong to.  So the SQL query would select from connected where the bond_type in bond is '#', using an INNER JOIN on bond_id. </think>  SELECT T1.atom_id, T1.atom_id2 FROM connected AS T1 INNER JOIN bond AS T2 ON T1.bond_id = T2.bond_id WHERE T2.bond_type = '#'
SELECT DISTINCT atom_id FROM (   SELECT atom_id2 AS atom_id   FROM connected   WHERE atom_id IN (SELECT atom_id FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR181')   UNION   SELECT atom_id   FROM connected   WHERE atom_id2 IN (SELECT atom_id FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR181') ) AS t; 
SELECT      (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN a.element != 'f' THEN m.molecule_id END) * 100) / COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) FROM molecule m LEFT JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id WHERE m.label = '+' GROUP BY m.molecule_id HAVING a.element != 'f'; 
SELECT      SUM(CASE WHEN bond.bond_type = '#' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100 / COUNT(bond.bond_id) AS percent FROM bond JOIN molecule ON bond.molecule_id = molecule.molecule_id WHERE molecule.label = '+'; 
SELECT element FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR000' GROUP BY element ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC, element ASC LIMIT 3; 
SELECT atom_id, atom_id2 FROM connected WHERE bond_id = 'TR001_2_6'; 
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN label = '+' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN label = '-' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS difference FROM molecule; 
SELECT atom_id, atom_id2 FROM connected WHERE bond_id = 'TR000_2_5'; 
SELECT DISTINCT bond_id FROM connected WHERE atom_id2 = 'TR000_2'; 
SELECT m.label FROM (     SELECT b.molecule_id, COUNT(*) as count     FROM bond b     WHERE b.bond_type = '='     GROUP BY b.molecule_id     HAVING COUNT(b.bond_type) >= 1 ) AS sub JOIN molecule m ON sub.molecule_id = m.molecule_id ORDER BY m.label ASC LIMIT 5; 
SELECT CAST(ROUND(CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN bond_type = '=' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(bond_id) * 100, 5) AS TEXT) || '%' AS result FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR008'; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to calculate the percentage of carcinogenic molecules in the database based on the given schema and data. Let me break this down step by step.  First, from the user's question, they mentioned that a molecule is considered carcinogenic if its label is '+'. So my goal is to find all molecules where the label is '+' and then calculate what percentage that is of all molecules in the database.  Looking at the schema, the relevant table here is the `molecule` table. It has two columns: `molecule_id` which is the primary key, and `label`, which can be either '+' or '-'.   I see that there are five entries in the `molecule` table: - TR000 with label '+' - TR001 with label '+' - TR002 with label '-' - TR004 with label '-' - TR006 with label '+'  So out of these five, three have a label of '+' (TR000, TR001, TR006) and two have '-' (TR002, TR004).  To calculate the percentage, I need to divide the number of '+' labels by the total number of molecules and then multiply by 100. The formula would be:  Percentage = (SUM OF '+' labels / COUNT OF all molecules) * 100  In SQL terms, this translates to using a combination of `COUNT` for the denominator and `SUM` with a conditional expression for the numerator.  I remember that in SQLite, I can use `CASE` statements within aggregate functions like `SUM`. So for each row, if the label is '+', it adds 1; otherwise, it adds 0. This effectively counts the number of '+' labels.   The total count of molecules is straightforward using `COUNT(molecule_id)` since every molecule has a unique ID.  Putting this together, I can write a query that selects from the `molecule` table, calculates the sum of '+' labels and divides by the total count, then multiplies by 100 to get the percentage. To round it to three decimal places, I'll use the `ROUND` function with three decimal places as the second argument.  So the SQL would be something like: SELECT ROUND( (SUM(CASE WHEN label = '+' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(molecule_id)) * 100, 3 ) AS percentage;  Let me double-check this logic. The `CASE` statement correctly counts each '+' as 1 and others as 0. Dividing by the count of all molecules gives the proportion, multiplying by 100 converts it to a percentage, and rounding ensures three decimal places.  I should make sure that I'm not missing any edge cases, like if there are no molecules or no carcinogenic ones. But in this dataset, there are five molecules with some '+' labels, so the query should work as intended. </think>  SELECT ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN label = '+' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(molecule_id)) * 100, 3) AS percentage;
SELECT CAST( (SUM(CASE WHEN element = 'h' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(atom_id)) * 100 AS DECIMAL(10,4) ) FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR206'; 
SELECT bond_type FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR000'; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for the elements of the toxicology and the label of the molecule TR060. Let me start by understanding what each part means.  First, looking at the database schema provided. There are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. Each has specific columns.  The 'molecule' table has two columns: molecule_id and label. The user is asking about the label of molecule TR060, so I can get that directly from this table by selecting the label where molecule_id is 'TR060'.  Next, the elements part. The 'atom' table contains atoms with their element information. Each atom belongs to a molecule via the molecule_id foreign key. So, to get all elements in molecule TR060, I need to select the element column from the atom table where molecule_id is 'TR060'. However, since each row represents an individual atom, this might return multiple rows for the same element if there are multiple atoms of that type.  Wait, but do we want distinct elements or just all elements? The user didn't specify, but typically when asking for elements in a molecule, they probably mean each unique element present. So I should include DISTINCT to avoid duplicates.  So putting it together, the SQL query needs two parts: one for the label and another for the elements. Since both are from different tables, I'll need to select them separately. Alternatively, if I want both pieces of information in a single query, perhaps using subqueries or joins, but since they're from different tables without a direct link beyond molecule_id, it's probably best to just write two separate SELECT statements.  Wait, the user might be expecting a combined result, like having both label and elements in one output. But if I do that, how? Since the elements are multiple rows and the label is one row, maybe using a join isn't straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps use a UNION operator to combine the results, but that would require converting them into similar structures.  Alternatively, perhaps the user wants two separate pieces of information: first the label, then the list of elements. So I can write two SELECT statements, one for the label and another for the distinct elements.  But let me check if TR060 exists in the tables. Looking at the INSERT INTO molecule commands, I see TR000, TR001, TR002, TR004, TR006, but not TR060. That's a problem because if there are no entries for TR060 in any table, the query will return nothing.  But the user is asking about TR060, so perhaps it's assumed that the data exists even though it wasn't provided. So I should proceed under the assumption that TR060 does exist in the molecule table and has corresponding atoms.  Therefore, my SQL query needs to select the label from molecule where molecule_id is 'TR060' and also select distinct elements from atom where molecule_id is 'TR060'.  I think using two separate SELECT statements would be appropriate here. Alternatively, if I can combine them into a single result set with multiple columns, but that might complicate things.  Wait, no, the user just wants to get both pieces of information. So perhaps the best way is to write:  SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id = 'TR060'; SELECT DISTINCT element FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR060';  But since the question says to output the corresponding SQL query, maybe they expect it as a single statement. Alternatively, if I need to combine them into one result set with multiple columns, perhaps using a CROSS JOIN or something else.  Alternatively, perhaps the user expects to see both pieces of information in one query, but that might not be necessary since the two selects are independent.  But looking back at the extra knowledge provided: TR060 is the molecule_id. So I think the intended answer is to select label from molecule and elements from atom where molecule_id is TR060.  So putting it all together, the SQL queries would be:  SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id = 'TR060'; SELECT DISTINCT element FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR060';  But since the user might expect a single query that returns both results, perhaps using UNION to combine them into one result set. However, since they are different data types (text for label and text for elements), it's possible but not necessary.  Alternatively, if I need to write just two separate SELECT statements as part of the same SQL batch, that's acceptable.  In conclusion, the correct approach is to select the label from molecule where molecule_id is TR060 and separately select distinct elements from atom where molecule_id is TR060. </think>  SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id = 'TR060'; SELECT DISTINCT element FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR060';
   SELECT bond_type     FROM bond     WHERE molecule_id = 'TR010'    GROUP BY bond_type    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC    LIMIT 1;    
<think> Okay, I need to write an SQL query that lists the top three molecules meeting certain criteria. Let me break down what's needed.  First, the user wants molecules that have single bonds between atoms. From the bond table, a single bond is where bond_type is '-'. So I'll need to join the molecule and bond tables on molecule_id and filter for bond_type = '-'.  Next, the molecules should not be carcinogenic. The label in the molecule table indicates this: if it's '-', then it's non-carcinogenic. So I'll include a condition where label = '-'.  I also need to order the results alphabetically by molecule_id and return the top three. That means using ORDER BY molecule_id ASC and LIMIT 3.  Putting it all together, I'll select from molecule, join with bond on molecule_id, add the conditions for bond_type and label, then order and limit the results. </think>  SELECT m.molecule_id FROM molecule m JOIN bond b ON m.molecule_id = b.molecule_id WHERE b.bond_type = '-' AND m.label = '-' ORDER BY m.molecule_id ASC LIMIT 3;
SELECT DISTINCT bond_type FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR006' ORDER BY bond_type ASC LIMIT 2; 
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM connected  WHERE (atom_id = 'TR009_12' OR atom_id2 = 'TR009_12')  AND bond_id IN (     SELECT bond_id FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR009' ); 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) FROM molecule m JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id WHERE m.label = '+' AND a.element = 'br'; 
SELECT b.bond_type, c.atom_id, c.atom_id2  FROM bond b  JOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id  WHERE b.bond_id = 'TR001_6_9'; 
SELECT m.molecule_id, m.label  FROM atom a  INNER JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id  WHERE a.atom_id = 'TR001_10'; 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT molecule_id) AS number_of_molecules_with_triple_bond  FROM bond  WHERE bond_type = '#'; 
SELECT COUNT(*) / 2 AS num_connections  FROM connected  WHERE atom_id LIKE 'TR%_19' OR atom_id2 LIKE 'TR%_19'; 
SELECT element FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR004'; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "How many of the molecules are not carcinogenic?" From the extra knowledge provided, I know that a molecule is considered non-carcinogenic if its label is '-'.   First, looking at the database schema, there's a table called `molecule` which has columns `molecule_id` and `label`. The `label` column is where the value '-' indicates non-carcinogenic. So my task is to count how many rows in this table have `label` set to '-'.  I remember that in SQL, to count the number of records meeting a condition, I can use the COUNT() function along with a WHERE clause. The basic structure would be something like SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table WHERE condition.  In this case, my table is `molecule`, and the condition is that `label` equals '-'. So putting it together, the query should select the count of all rows where label is '-'.  I also need to make sure I'm only counting each molecule once. Since each row in the `molecule` table represents a unique molecule (because `molecule_id` is the primary key), using COUNT(*) is appropriate here because it counts each row that meets the condition.  So, the SQL query should be straightforward: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule WHERE label = '-'. This will return the number of molecules with the label '-', which corresponds to non-carcinogenic molecules. </think>  To determine how many molecules are not carcinogenic, we count the rows in the `molecule` table where the `label` is '-'.  **Answer:**   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule WHERE label = '-';

<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to help the user by writing an SQL query based on their question. The task is to list the bond type and bond ID of the atom 45.  First, looking at the extra knowledge provided: the bond ID for atom 45 is derived using SUBSTR(atom_id, 7, 2) + 0 = 45. So, I need to extract the substring starting from position 7 with a length of 2 and ensure it equals '45'.  The tables involved are `atom` and `connected`, as the `bond` table doesn't directly link atoms without going through connections.  I'll start by selecting atom_id from the `atom` table where the condition SUBSTR(atom_id, 7, 2) = '45'. This will give me the specific atom of interest.  Next, I need to join this with the `connected` table. Since each connection has two atoms (atom_id and atom_id2), I'll use a UNION to cover both possibilities that either atom could be 45 in different rows.  Once connected, I'll link to the `bond` table using the bond_id to get the bond type.  Putting it all together, I'll select distinct results to avoid duplicates and ensure each relevant bond is listed once. </think>  SELECT DISTINCT T3.bond_type, T2.bond_id FROM atom AS T1 INNER JOIN connected AS T2 ON T1.atom_id = T2.atom_id OR T1.atom_id = T2.atom_id2 INNER JOIN bond AS T3 ON T2.bond_id = T3.bond_id WHERE SUBSTR(T1.atom_id, 7, 2) + 0 = 45

<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "How many elements are there for single bond molecules?" The user mentioned that a single bond is where the bond_type is '-', so that's my starting point.  First, let me understand the database schema provided. There are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule.   The 'molecule' table has each molecule with an id and a label. The 'bond' table includes information about each bond, including its type. The 'atom' table lists all atoms in each molecule, and the 'connected' table shows which atoms are bonded together via which bond_id.  The goal is to count elements (types of atoms) that are part of molecules where there's at least one single bond (bond_type = '-'). So I need to find all such molecules and then count their distinct elements.  I think I should approach this by first identifying all the molecule_ids that have a '-' bond. Then, for those molecules, collect all the unique elements from the atom table. Finally, count how many different elements there are in total across these molecules.  To do this step-by-step:  1. Select all molecule_ids from the bond table where bond_type is '-'. This gives me the molecules with single bonds. 2. For each of those molecule_ids, get their atoms and collect the distinct element values. 3. Count how many unique elements are present in total across these molecules.  So I'll need a subquery to find the relevant molecule_ids. Then join that with the atom table on molecule_id and count the distinct elements.  I should use a COUNT(DISTINCT) on the element field from the atom table where molecule_id is in the list of single bond molecules.  Putting it all together, the SQL query would look something like:  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.element) FROM atom a WHERE a.molecule_id IN (SELECT b.molecule_id FROM bond b WHERE b.bond_type = '-')  This should give me the total number of unique elements in molecules that have at least one single bond. </think>  To determine how many different elements are present in molecules with at least one single bond, we need to:  1. Identify all molecules that have a single bond (bond_type = '-') from the `bond` table. 2. Collect all unique elements (`element`) from these identified molecules using the `atom` table.  **Answer:**  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.element) FROM atom a WHERE a.molecule_id IN (SELECT b.molecule_id FROM bond b WHERE b.bond_type = '-')
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM atom a WHERE a.molecule_id IN (   SELECT b.molecule_id FROM bond b WHERE b.bond_type = '#' ) AND a.molecule_id IN (   SELECT a2.molecule_id FROM atom a2 WHERE a2.element IN ('p', 'br') ); 
SELECT b.bond_id FROM bond b INNER JOIN molecule m ON b.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE m.label = '+'; 
SELECT m.molecule_id  FROM molecule m  WHERE m.label = '-'  AND m.molecule_id IN (SELECT b.molecule_id FROM bond b WHERE b.bond_type = '-'); 
SELECT      (COUNT(CASE WHEN a.element = 'cl' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(a.atom_id)) * 100 AS cl_percentage FROM atom a WHERE a.molecule_id IN (     SELECT DISTINCT b.molecule_id FROM bond b WHERE b.bond_type = '-' ); 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that retrieves the labels for the molecules with IDs TR000, TR001, and TR002. Let me start by understanding the problem.  First, looking at the database schema provided, there's a table called `molecule` which has two columns: `molecule_id` (which is the primary key) and `label`. The label indicates whether a molecule is carcinogenic ('+') or non-carcinogenic ('-').  The user is asking for the labels of three specific molecules: TR000, TR001, and TR002. So I need to extract the 'label' column from the `molecule` table where the `molecule_id` matches any of these three values.  I remember that in SQL, to select specific rows based on conditions, we use the WHERE clause along with the IN operator when dealing with multiple values. The IN operator allows me to specify a list of values and returns rows where the column matches any of those values.  So the structure of the query should be something like: SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id IN ('TR000', 'TR001', 'TR002');  I don't think I need to join any other tables because all the necessary information is in the `molecule` table. The user only wants the labels, so selecting just the 'label' column suffices.  Let me double-check if there are any molecules with those IDs. Looking at the INSERT statements for the `molecule` table:  - TR000 has label '+' - TR001 has label '+' - TR002 has label '-'  So the query should return three rows, each with their respective labels.  I should also consider whether the molecule_ids provided actually exist in the database to avoid errors. But since the user is asking specifically for these IDs and they are present in the INSERT statements, it's safe.  Another thought: should I use any aliases or additional clauses? Since the question is straightforward, a simple SELECT statement should suffice without any extra features like ordering or grouping.  Putting it all together, the SQL query will select the label column from the molecule table where the molecule_id is one of TR000, TR001, or TR002. </think>  SELECT `label` FROM `molecule` WHERE `molecule_id` IN ('TR000', 'TR001', 'TR002');
SELECT molecule_id FROM molecule WHERE label = '-'; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to calculate the total number of carcinogenic molecules where the molecule ID ranges from TR000 to TR030. Let me go through this step by step.  First, I remember that in the database schema provided, there's a `molecule` table which has two columns: `molecule_id` and `label`. The label '+' indicates a carcinogenic molecule, while '-' does not. So my main focus will be on this table because it contains the information about whether each molecule is carcinogenic.  The user wants to count all molecules where the ID starts with 'TR' followed by three digits, specifically from TR000 to TR030. That means I need to filter rows in the `molecule` table where `molecule_id` falls within this range and has a label of '+'.  I should use the COUNT() function to get the total number. The condition for counting will be based on two criteria: the molecule ID being between TR000 and TR030, and the label being '+'.   To represent the range from TR000 to TR030 in SQL, I can use string comparisons since the IDs are strings starting with 'TR' followed by numbers. So, I'll write a WHERE clause that selects rows where `molecule_id` is greater than or equal to 'TR000' and less than or equal to 'TR030', and `label` equals '+'.  Putting this together, my SQL query will select the count of all such rows in the `molecule` table. I don't need any joins because all necessary information is in one table.   I also need to make sure that the comparison is correct for string IDs, as sometimes numerical comparisons might not work if the IDs are treated as strings but have leading zeros. But since they're consistent (all start with 'TR' and followed by three digits), using string comparison should be fine.  So, the final SQL query will count all rows in `molecule` where `molecule_id` is between 'TR000' and 'TR030' and `label` is '+'. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule WHERE label = '+' AND molecule_id BETWEEN 'TR000' AND 'TR030';
SELECT bond_type FROM bond WHERE molecule_id LIKE 'TR%' AND CAST(substr(molecule_id, 3) AS INT) BETWEEN 0 AND 50; 
SELECT DISTINCT T1.element AS element1, T2.element AS element2 FROM atom T1 JOIN connected C ON T1.atom_id = C.atom_id JOIN atom T2 ON C.atom_id2 = T2.atom_id WHERE C.bond_id = 'TR001_10_11'; 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.bond_id) FROM connected c LEFT JOIN atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id LEFT JOIN atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id WHERE a1.element = 'i' OR a2.element = 'i'; 
SELECT      SUM(CASE WHEN m.label = '+' THEN 1 ELSE 0) AS carcinogenic_count,     SUM(CASE WHEN m.label = '-' THEN 1 ELSE 0) AS non_carcinogenic_count FROM (     SELECT DISTINCT molecule_id      FROM atom      WHERE element = 'ca' ) a JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id; 
SELECT c.* FROM connected c JOIN atom a ON c.atom_id = a.atom_id JOIN atom b ON c.atom_id2 = b.atom_id WHERE c.bond_id = 'TR001_1_8' AND (a.element = 'cl' AND b.element = 'c' OR a.element = 'c' AND b.element = 'cl'); 
SELECT m.molecule_id FROM molecule m WHERE m.label = '-' AND EXISTS (   SELECT 1    FROM bond b    WHERE b.molecule_id = m.molecule_id      AND b.bond_type = '#' ) AND EXISTS (   SELECT 1    FROM atom a    WHERE a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id      AND a.element = 'c' ) LIMIT 2; 
SELECT      (SUM(CASE WHEN A.element = 'cl' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(A.atom_id)) * 100  FROM      Atom A JOIN      Molecule M ON A.molecule_id = M.molecule_id WHERE      M.label = '+'; 
SELECT element FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR001'; 
<think> Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to write an SQL query that retrieves the molecule ID where there's a double bond. From the provided data, I know that a double bond is represented by '=' in the bond_type column of the bond table.  First, I need to identify which table contains the bond information. Looking at the schema, the bond table has columns: bond_id, molecule_id, and bond_type. So, this is where I'll look for double bonds.  The next step is to find all rows in the bond table where bond_type equals '='. That makes sense because the user mentioned that double bonds are stored as ' = '. However, I notice there's a space around the equal sign in the data, like ' = ', so I should include those spaces in my WHERE clause to ensure accuracy.  Now, each molecule can have multiple bonds, but I only need to return distinct molecule_ids to avoid duplicates. Using SELECT DISTINCT will help with that.  Putting it all together, I'll select the molecule_id from the bond table where bond_type is exactly ' = '. This should give me all unique molecule IDs that have at least one double bond. </think>  SELECT DISTINCT molecule_id FROM bond WHERE bond_type = ' = '
SELECT T1.atom_id, T1.atom_id2  FROM connected AS T1  INNER JOIN bond AS T2  ON T1.bond_id = T2.bond_id  WHERE T2.bond_type = '#'; 
SELECT T1.element FROM atom AS T1 WHERE T1.atom_id IN ( SELECT T2.atom_id FROM connected AS T2 WHERE T2.bond_id = 'TR000_1_2' ) 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how many single bond type molecules are non-carcinogenic based on the provided database schema and data.  First, let me understand the problem. The user is asking for a count of molecules that meet two criteria: they must have single bonds (bond_type = '-') and be non-carcinogenic (label = '-').   Looking at the tables:  1. **molecule table**: This has molecule_id and label. The label '-' indicates non-carcinogenic. 2. **bond table**: Contains bond_id, molecule_id, and bond_type. We're interested in bond_type '-'.  I think I need to count how many molecules have a label of '-' and also have at least one single bond (bond_type '-'). Wait, no—actually, the question is about molecules that are entirely composed of single bonds? Or just have any single bonds? Hmm, the wording says "single bond type", which might mean all bonds in the molecule are single. But I'm not sure.  Wait, maybe it's simpler: each molecule can have multiple bonds, but as long as at least one is a single bond, and the molecule is non-carcinogenic. Or does it require that all bonds are single? The question isn't entirely clear, but perhaps in this context, "single bond type" refers to molecules where any of their bonds are single.  But wait, looking back: the user provided extra knowledge says "single bond refers to bond_type = '-';". So each bond can be a single. But the molecule's label being '-' indicates non-carcinogenic.  So I think the approach is:  - For each molecule with label '-', count it if at least one of its bonds is of type '-'.  But wait, maybe 'single bond type' refers to molecules that have only single bonds? Or perhaps it just needs to include any single bonds. The question says "single bond type molecules", which might imply that all their bonds are single, but I'm not certain. However, given the data in the bond table, let's see:  Looking at the INSERTs for bond:  For TR000: multiple '-', one '-' (from TR001 has '='). Wait no, the TR001 bond is '=', so TR000 has four '-' bonds and one '-'. So all its bonds are single.  Wait, looking again:  In the bond table:  - For molecule_id 'TR000', there are four entries with bond_type '-': TR000_1_2, TR000_2_3, etc. So all bonds in TR000 are single. - TR001 has one '=', so it's a double bond.  So perhaps for this question, we're looking for molecules where label is '-' (non-carcinogenic) and have at least one bond of type '-', but maybe more specifically, that they consist only of single bonds. But the user didn't specify that all bonds must be single, just that it's a single bond type molecule.  Wait, maybe "single bond type" refers to molecules where any bond is single, so regardless of other bond types, as long as at least one is single and label is '-'.  But perhaps in this context, the question is asking for molecules with non-carcinogenic (label '-'), that have at least one single bond.  So I need to join molecule and bond tables on molecule_id where label is '-', and bond_type is '-'.  But wait, a molecule can have multiple bonds. So if a molecule has any single bond, it would count as having a single bond type? Or does the question mean molecules that are only made up of single bonds?  I think in this case, since the user's instruction says "single bond refers to bond_type = '-'", perhaps each individual bond is considered. So for the purpose of counting, any molecule with label '-', and at least one bond of type '-', should be counted.  But wait, looking back at the initial example:  In the bond table, TR000 has multiple bonds all of type '-', so it's a single bond type molecule. TR001 has a double bond '='. So perhaps in this context, "single bond type" means that the molecule contains any single bonds, regardless of other bond types.  But I'm not entirely sure. The question is: count how many molecules are non-carcinogenic (label '-') and have at least one single bond (bond_type '-'). Or does it mean they must consist only of single bonds?  Given the data, for example:  - TR000 has all '-' bonds, so it's a single bond molecule. - TR001 has an '=' bond, so not a single bond type.  But suppose another molecule had both '-' and '=', would that count? The question is ambiguous. But perhaps in this context, the user wants to count molecules where at least one bond is '-', regardless of other bonds.  So, I'll proceed under that assumption.  Now, to write the SQL query:  1. Select from molecule where label = '-' 2. Join with bond on molecule_id 3. Where bond_type = '-' 4. Count distinct molecules (since a molecule could have multiple '-' bonds, but we only count it once)  So using COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) to avoid counting duplicates.  Thus, the SQL would be:  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) FROM molecule m JOIN bond b ON m.molecule_id = b.molecule_id WHERE m.label = '-' AND b.bond_type = '-';  But wait, what if a molecule has label '-', but no bonds? Well, according to the data provided, each molecule seems to have at least one bond. But to be safe, perhaps using LEFT JOIN and checking for bond existence.  Alternatively, since the bond table has entries for each molecule, maybe it's okay with INNER JOIN.  But in this case, I think using INNER JOIN is appropriate because if a molecule had no bonds, it wouldn't appear in the count anyway.  So the final query would be as above. </think>  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) FROM molecule m INNER JOIN bond b ON m.molecule_id = b.molecule_id WHERE m.label = '-' AND b.bond_type = '-';
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out what the SQL query should be for the question "What is the label for bond ID TR001_10_11?". Let me break this down step by step.  First, looking at the database schema provided, there are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The bond table has columns bond_id, molecule_id, and bond_type. Each bond is associated with a specific molecule via the molecule_id foreign key.  The user wants to find the label of the molecule that a particular bond belongs to. Specifically, they're asking about bond ID TR001_10_11. Since the bond table links to the molecule table through molecule_id, I can start by finding which molecule this bond is part of.  So, I should query the bond table where bond_id equals 'TR001_10_11' and retrieve the corresponding molecule_id. Once I have that molecule_id, I can then look up its label in the molecule table.  The next step is to join these two tables. I'll select the label from the molecule table where the molecule_id matches the one obtained from the bond with the specified ID. This way, I can get the exact label associated with that bond's molecule.  Putting it all together, I can write a SELECT statement that gets the label by linking the bond and molecule tables through their shared molecule_id. Using an INNER JOIN makes sense here because I want to combine rows where the molecule_id exists in both tables.  I should also ensure that I'm only retrieving one record since each bond is associated with exactly one molecule, so adding a LIMIT 1 might be good practice to optimize the query.  So, the final SQL would join the bond and molecule tables on molecule_id, filter for the specific bond ID, and select the label from the molecule table. </think>  SELECT T2.label FROM bond AS T1 INNER JOIN molecule AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id WHERE T1.bond_id = 'TR001_10_11' LIMIT 1;
<think> Okay, I need to solve this SQL problem based on the user's question and the provided database schema. Let me break it down step by step.  First, the task is to "Enumerate the bond ID of triple bond type molecules and tell me if they are carcinogenic or not." The extra knowledge says that a triple bond has bond_type = '#', and the molecule's label '+' means carcinogenic, '-' means non-carcinogenic.  So I need to get all bonds where the type is '#'. Then, for each such bond, determine if the corresponding molecule is carcinogenic based on its label.  Looking at the database schema:  - The `bond` table has columns bond_id, molecule_id, and bond_type. - The `molecule` table has molecule_id and label.  I can join these two tables on molecule_id to link each bond to its molecule's carcinogenic status.  The steps I need to take in SQL are:  1. Select bond_id from the bond table where bond_type is '#'. 2. For each of those bonds, get their molecule_id. 3. Join with the molecule table to check the label of that molecule. 4. Output both the bond_id and whether it's carcinogenic (based on the label).  Wait, but how do I structure this? Since the user wants two pieces of information: the bond ID and whether it's carcinogenic or not. So for each triple bond, I need to get its ID and then check the molecule's label.  I can use a SELECT statement with a JOIN between bond and molecule on molecule_id. Then, in the SELECT clause, I'll include bond_id and a CASE statement that checks the label: if it's '+', then 'carcinogenic', else 'non-carcinogenic'.  Let me think about the SQL syntax:  SELECT      b.bond_id,     CASE m.label WHEN '+' THEN 'carcinogenic' ELSE 'non-carcinogenic' END as carcinogenic FROM bond b JOIN molecule m ON b.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE b.bond_type = '#';  Wait, but the user didn't specify any particular ordering. Do I need to order the results? The question just says to enumerate, so maybe ordering by bond_id is fine, but it's not necessary unless specified.  So the final SQL should join the two tables on molecule_id, filter where bond_type is '#', and then for each such bond, output the bond_id and whether the molecule is carcinogenic based on its label. </think>  SELECT b.bond_id, CASE m.label WHEN '+' THEN 'carcinogenic' ELSE 'non-carcinogenic' END AS carcinogenic FROM bond b JOIN molecule m ON b.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE b.bond_type = '#'
<think> Okay, I need to solve this SQL problem based on the given database schema and data. Let me try to break down what's being asked.  The question is: "Tally the toxicology element of the 4th atom of each molecule that was carcinogenic."   From the extra knowledge provided: - The label '+' in the molecule table indicates a carcinogenic molecule. - The 4th atom refers to those atoms where the atom_id has '4' as the 7th character. So, substr(atom_id, 7, 1) = '4'.    So, I need to find all molecules that are carcinogenic (label '+'), then for each of these, look at their 4th atom (based on the atom_id), get the element of those atoms, and tally how many times each element appears.  First step: Identify all carcinogenic molecules. That means selecting from the molecule table where label is '+'.  Next, for each such molecule, find the atoms that are the 4th in their structure. Since the atom_id is structured like 'TR000_1', the 7th character would be '1' for this one. So, to get the 4th atom, I need substr(atom_id, 7, 1) = '4'.  Once I have these atoms, extract their elements from the atom table.  Then, group by element and count how many times each occurs.  So, putting it together:  1. Select molecules where label is '+'. 2. For each of those molecule_ids, get all atoms with substr(atom_id, 7, 1) = '4'. 3. Get their elements from the atom table. 4. Group by element and count occurrences.  I think I can do this with a SELECT statement that includes a subquery or joins. Since the molecules can have multiple atoms, but we're only interested in the 4th one, maybe a join on molecule_id where atom meets the condition.  Wait, actually, each molecule will have an atom with ID ending with '_4', so for each such molecule, there should be exactly one atom meeting substr(atom_id,7,1)='4'. So I can join the molecule and atom tables on molecule_id, filter for label '+', and then filter atoms where their position is 4.  So the SQL structure would be:  SELECT      element,     COUNT(*) as tally FROM      molecule m JOIN      atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id WHERE      m.label = '+' AND substr(a.atom_id,7,1) = '4' GROUP BY      element;  Let me check if this makes sense. The JOIN connects each molecule to its atoms. Then the WHERE clause filters for carcinogenic molecules and picks the 4th atom. Grouping by element then counts how many times each element appears in that position across all such molecules.  Yes, I think that should work. </think>  To solve the problem, we need to count the elements of the 4th atom in each molecule that is labeled as carcinogenic (label '+'). The approach involves joining the `molecule` and `atom` tables, filtering for the required conditions, and then grouping by the element to tally the counts.  **Answer:**  SELECT      a.element,     COUNT(*) AS tally FROM      atom a JOIN      molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE      m.label = '+' AND substr(a.atom_id, 7, 1) = '4' GROUP BY      a.element;
SELECT      (SUM(CASE WHEN element = 'h' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(atom_id)) AS hydrogen_ratio,     (SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id = 'TR006') AS label FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR006'; 
SELECT * FROM atom JOIN molecule ON atom.molecule_id = molecule.molecule_id WHERE element = 'ca' AND label = '+'; 
SELECT DISTINCT b.bond_type  FROM bond b  INNER JOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id  INNER JOIN atom a ON c.atom_id = a.atom_id  WHERE a.element = 'c'; 
SELECT element AS Element1 FROM atom WHERE atom_id = 'TR001_10' UNION SELECT element AS Element2 FROM atom WHERE atom_id = 'TR001_11'; 
SELECT      (COUNT(DISTINCT b.molecule_id) / (SELECT COUNT(molecule_id) FROM molecule)) * 100 FROM bond b WHERE b.bond_type = '#'; 
SELECT      (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR047' AND bond_type = '=') /      (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR047') * 100; 
SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id = (SELECT molecule_id FROM atom WHERE atom_id = 'TR001_1'); 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out if molecule TR151 is carcinogenic using SQL based on the provided database schema and data. Let me start by understanding what each table represents.  First, there's the `molecule` table which has columns: `molecule_id` (primary key) and `label`. The label can be '+' or '-'. From the extra knowledge, I know that a label of '+' means the molecule is carcinogenic. So, if TR151 has a label '+', it's carcinogenic.  Looking at the data in the `molecule` table, I see entries like 'TR000' with label '+', but there's no entry for TR151. Wait, does that mean anything? Maybe TR151 isn't present in the database yet. But the question is about whether it's carcinogenic, so perhaps I need to check if it exists and has a '+' label.  So the SQL query should select from the `molecule` table where `molecule_id` is 'TR151' and `label` is '+'. That would tell me if TR151 is carcinogenic. If such a row exists, then yes; otherwise, no.  I don't think any joins are needed because the information is directly in the `molecule` table. The other tables like `atom`, `bond`, and `connected` seem to contain structural data about atoms and bonds within molecules, but for this question, those aren't necessary since we're only checking the label of the molecule itself.  So the SQL should be straightforward: select 1 (or any indicator) where the conditions are met. Alternatively, just check if such a row exists, but using COUNT or CASE might complicate it. Since I just need to know if it's carcinogenic, selecting the condition directly makes sense. </think>  SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id = 'TR151' AND label = '+'
<think> Alright, so the user is asking me to write an SQL query to determine which toxic elements are present in the molecule TR151. Let's break this down step by step.  First, I need to understand the database schema provided. There are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The relevant table here is the 'atom' table because it contains information about each atom in a molecule, including the element.  Looking at the 'atom' table structure, each entry has an atom_id, molecule_id, and element. The molecule_id connects to the 'molecule' table, which lists all molecules with their IDs and labels. However, since the question is specifically about TR151, I can focus on the 'atom' table.  The user provided some example data. For instance, in the 'molecule' table, there's an entry for TR000, but not for TR151. This suggests that TR151 might be another molecule in the database or perhaps a hypothetical one. But regardless, the approach remains the same: I need to look for atoms where the molecule_id is 'TR151'.  Next, considering the elements and their toxicity. The user provided a mapping of element abbreviations to their names, including some toxic ones like Cl (Chlorine), Br (Bromine), Pb (Lead), etc. So, the task is to find any atoms in TR151 that have an element corresponding to these toxic substances.  The SQL query needs to select the 'element' from the 'atom' table where molecule_id is 'TR151'. That's straightforward. However, I should also consider if there are multiple atoms of the same element; the DISTINCT keyword ensures each toxic element is listed only once, even if it appears multiple times in the molecule.  Putting it all together, the SQL query will select distinct elements from atom where molecule_id matches TR151 and then check if those elements are toxic based on the provided mapping. But since the user only wants the SQL without comments or additional processing, I'll focus solely on extracting the elements for TR151. </think>  SELECT element FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR151' AND element IN ('cl', 'c', 'h', 'o', 's', 'n', 'p', 'na', 'br', 'f', 'i', 'sn', 'pb', 'te', 'ca')
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "How many chemical compounds in the database are identified as carcinogenic."   First, let's break down what the user is asking for. They want a count of all compounds that are carcinogenic. From the extra knowledge provided, I know that in the molecule table, the label '+' indicates that the molecule is carcinogenic.  So, the key information here is: - The 'label' column in the 'molecule' table determines if a compound is carcinogenic. - A '+' means it's carcinogenic.  I should focus on the 'molecule' table because that's where the label is stored. My task is to count how many rows (which represent molecules) have their 'label' set to '+'.  The SQL query needs to select from the molecule table and filter where label is '+'. Then, I need to count those entries.  I'll structure it like this: 1. Use SELECT COUNT(*) to get the number of rows. 2. FROM the molecule table. 3. WHERE the label is '+'.  I don't think any joins are needed because all necessary info is in one table. Also, since each molecule_id is unique and represents a different compound, counting the rows with label '+' will give the correct count.  So putting it together, the SQL query is straightforward. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule WHERE label = '+';
<think> Okay, I need to help the user by writing an SQL query based on their question. Let me break down what they're asking for.  First, the goal is to identify atoms that belong to a specific range of molecules and contain carbon. The molecule ID should be between TR010 to TR050, which translates to the numeric part being 10 to 50. Also, the element we're looking for is 'c' since that's carbon in this context.  Looking at the database schema, the relevant table here is the `atom` table because it contains information about each atom, including its element and the molecule it belongs to. The `molecule_id` in the `atom` table links to the `molecule` table, but I don't think we need that for this query since we can filter directly using `molecule_id`.  So, the steps are: 1. Extract the numeric part from the `molecule_id`. Since IDs like TR010 have 'TR' as a prefix followed by numbers, I'll use the `substr` function to get the last three characters and convert them to an integer. 2. Filter where this numeric value is between 10 and 50 inclusive. 3. Ensure that the element is 'c'.  Putting it all together in SQL, I'll select the `atom_id` from the `atom` table where these two conditions are met. That should give me exactly the atoms containing carbon in the specified molecule range. </think>  SELECT atom_id FROM atom WHERE substr(molecule_id, 3, 3) BETWEEN 10 AND 50 AND element = 'c';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM atom WHERE molecule_id IN (SELECT molecule_id FROM molecule WHERE label = '+'); 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "Which bond IDs are double-bonded with carcinogenic compounds?"   First, let's break down the problem. The user has provided a database schema with four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. Each of these tables has specific columns and relationships.  The key points from the question and the extra knowledge:  1. **Carcinogenic Compounds**: These are molecules where the label is '+' in the molecule table. 2. **Double Bonds**: These are bonds where the bond_type is '=' in the bond table. 3. The goal is to find the bond IDs that are double-bonded with these carcinogenic compounds.  So, I need to connect the bond information with the molecule's label. Let's look at the tables:  - The **molecule** table has 'molecule_id' and 'label'. So, for a compound to be carcinogenic, its label must be '+'. - The **bond** table has 'bond_id', 'molecule_id', and 'bond_type'. We need bonds where bond_type is '='. - Since each bond is associated with a molecule via 'molecule_id', we can link the two tables.  I think I should join the bond and molecule tables on 'molecule_id'. That way, I can filter for molecules where label is '+' and bonds where type is '='.   So, the SQL query should select bond_ids from both tables where these conditions are met.  Wait, do I need any other tables? The question doesn't mention atoms or connected atoms specifically, just the bonds and whether they're in a carcinogenic molecule. So, I don't think I need to involve the atom or connected tables here.  Putting it all together, the SQL should be:  SELECT b.bond_id FROM bond b INNER JOIN molecule m ON b.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE m.label = '+' AND b.bond_type = '=';  This way, we're selecting all bonds that are double-bonds (bond_type '=') in molecules that are carcinogenic (label '+'). </think>  SELECT bond_id FROM bond WHERE bond_type = ' = ' AND molecule_id IN (SELECT molecule_id FROM molecule WHERE label = '+');
SELECT COUNT(a.atom_id) FROM atom a INNER JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE a.element = 'h' AND m.label = '+'; 
SELECT b.molecule_id  FROM bond b  WHERE b.bond_id = 'TR000_1_2'  AND (b.bond_id IN (     SELECT c.bond_id      FROM connected c      WHERE c.atom_id = 'TR000_1' OR c.atom_id2 = 'TR000_1' )); 
SELECT A.atom_id FROM atom A INNER JOIN molecule M ON A.molecule_id = M.molecule_id WHERE A.element = 'c' AND M.label = '-'; 
SELECT      (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN m.label = '+' AND a.element = 'h' THEN m.molecule_id END) / COUNT(DISTINCT a.molecule_id)) * 100.0 AS percentage FROM molecule m JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id; 
SELECT 1 FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id = 'TR124' AND label = '+'; 
SELECT * FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR186'; 
<think> Okay, let's tackle this SQL problem step by step. The user is asking for the bond type of TR007_4_19. Hmm, first I need to figure out where this information might be stored.  Looking at the database schema provided, there are three relevant tables: `bond`, `connected`, and `molecule`. But wait, the `bond` table seems promising because it has a `bond_id` column which could match TR007_4_19.   I check the `bond` table's structure. It has columns for bond_id, molecule_id, and bond_type. The user mentioned that bond types are '-', '=', and '#', corresponding to single, double, and triple bonds respectively. So, if TR007_4_19 is a bond_id, I can directly query this table.  I also notice the `connected` table links atoms via bond_ids, but since we already have the bond_id, querying the `bond` table directly would be more efficient. Plus, the user didn't specify any need for additional information from other tables like molecule details or connected atoms.  So, I'll write a SELECT statement to fetch the bond_type where bond_id is 'TR007_4_19'. That should give me the necessary information without needing joins or subqueries. </think>  SELECT bond_type FROM bond WHERE bond_id = 'TR007_4_19'
SELECT a1.element AS element1, a2.element AS element2 FROM connected c INNER JOIN atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id INNER JOIN atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id WHERE c.bond_id = 'TR001_2_4'; 
SELECT      (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR006' AND bond_type = ' = ') AS double_bonds,     (SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id = 'TR006') AS is_carcinogenic; 
SELECT DISTINCT m.molecule_id AS name, a.element  FROM molecule m  LEFT JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id  WHERE m.label = '+'; 
SELECT bond.bond_id, connected.atom_id, connected.atom_id2  FROM bond  INNER JOIN connected  ON bond.bond_id = connected.bond_id  WHERE bond.bond_type = '-'; 
SELECT      m.molecule_id,     GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT a.element) AS elements FROM atom a JOIN (     SELECT DISTINCT molecule_id FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '#' ) m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id GROUP BY m.molecule_id; 
SELECT a1.element AS atom1_element, a2.element AS atom2_element  FROM connected c  JOIN atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id  JOIN atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id  WHERE c.bond_id = 'TR000_2_3'; 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT bond_id)  FROM connected  WHERE atom_id IN (SELECT atom_id FROM atom WHERE element = 'cl')     OR atom_id2 IN (SELECT atom_id FROM atom WHERE element = 'cl'); 
SELECT atom_id FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR346'; 
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM molecule  WHERE molecule_id IN (     SELECT DISTINCT molecule_id      FROM bond      WHERE bond_type = '=' )  AND label = '+' 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) FROM molecule m LEFT JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id AND a.element = 's' LEFT JOIN bond b ON m.molecule_id = b.molecule_id AND b.bond_type = '=' WHERE a.atom_id IS NULL AND b.bond_id IS NULL; 
SELECT m.label FROM bond b JOIN molecule m ON b.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE b.bond_id = 'TR001_2_4'; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR001'; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '-'; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking which molecules that contain the "cl" element are carcinogenic. From the extra knowledge provided, a molecule is carcinogenic if its label is '+'.   First, I'll look at the database schema. There are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The relevant ones here are 'atom' and 'molecule'.  The 'atom' table has columns: atom_id, molecule_id, and element. The 'molecule' table has molecule_id and label.  I need to find all molecules where at least one of their atoms is 'cl'. Then, among those, determine which have a label of '+'.  So the steps are:  1. Select from the 'atom' table where element = 'cl'. 2. Get the distinct molecule_ids from these rows to avoid duplicates. 3. Join this result with the 'molecule' table on molecule_id. 4. Filter the joined results where label is '+'.  I can achieve this using a subquery or a join. Since I need distinct molecules, using DISTINCT in a subquery would be efficient.  So, the SQL query will select from 'molecule' where molecule_id is in the set of IDs from 'atom' with element 'cl', and then filter those to have label '+'. </think>  SELECT m.molecule_id FROM molecule m WHERE m.molecule_id IN ( SELECT DISTINCT a.molecule_id FROM atom a WHERE a.element = 'cl' ) AND m.label = '+'
SELECT DISTINCT m.molecule_id FROM atom a INNER JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE a.element = 'c' AND m.label = '-'; 
SELECT      (COUNT(DISTINCT a.molecule_id) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule WHERE label = '+')) * 100 AS chloro_percentage FROM atom a JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE a.element = 'Cl' AND m.label = '+'; 
<think> Okay, so I need to find the SQL query that gives me the molecule ID for a specific bond ID, which is TR001_1_7. Let's break this down step by step.  First, looking at the database schema provided, there are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. Each has its own structure and relationships through foreign keys.  The bond table seems to be where I should start because it directly relates to bond IDs. The bond table has columns: bond_id, molecule_id, and bond_type. So, if I can find the row in the bond table where bond_id is TR001_1_7, then the corresponding molecule_id would be the answer.  Wait a minute, though. Let me check the data provided. In the INSERT statements for the bond table, the entries are:  - ('TR000_1_2', 'TR000', '-') - ('TR000_2_3', 'TR000', '-') - ('TR000_2_4', 'TR000', '-') - ('TR000_2_5', 'TR000', '-') - ('TR001_10_11', 'TR001', '=')  I don't see any entry with bond_id TR001_1_7. Hmm, that's odd. So maybe the data provided doesn't include that specific bond ID. But perhaps in the actual database, it exists beyond what's provided here.  Assuming that the bond table does have a row where bond_id is 'TR001_1_7', I can write a SELECT statement to fetch the molecule_id from the bond table where bond_id matches TR001_1_7.  So the SQL query would be:  SELECT molecule_id FROM bond WHERE bond_id = 'TR001_1_7';  That's straightforward. It selects the molecule_id from the bond table where the bond_id is exactly TR001_1_7. Since each bond_id is a primary key, this should return one row if it exists.  I don't think I need to join with other tables because the molecule_id is directly in the bond table. So no joins are necessary here. It's a simple query on a single table. </think>  SELECT molecule_id FROM bond WHERE bond_id = 'TR001_1_7';
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a1.element)  FROM atom a1  JOIN connected c ON a1.atom_id = c.atom_id  WHERE c.bond_id = 'TR001_3_4'  UNION  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a2.element)  FROM atom a2  JOIN connected c ON a2.atom_id = c.atom_id2  WHERE c.bond_id = 'TR001_3_4'; 
SELECT b.bond_type  FROM connected c  INNER JOIN bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id  WHERE (c.atom_id = 'TR000_1' AND c.atom_id2 = 'TR000_2')     OR (c.atom_id = 'TR000_2' AND c.atom_id2 = 'TR000_1'); 
SELECT molecule_id FROM atom WHERE atom_id = 'TR000_2' OR atom_id = 'TR000_4'; 
<think> Okay, so the user is asking for an SQL query to find the element of toxicology for the atom with ID TR000_1. Let me break this down step by step.  First, I need to understand what's being asked. The term "element of toxicology" might be a bit confusing at first glance. But considering the extra knowledge provided, it seems like they're referring to the element associated with an atom in a molecule, which relates to toxicology elements. So, the goal is to retrieve the element from the atom table where the atom_id is TR000_1.  Looking at the database schema, there's an `atom` table with columns: atom_id (primary key), molecule_id, and element. The other tables like bond and connected seem related to how atoms are connected, but for this specific question, they don't seem necessary because we're only looking up a single atom's element.  The user provided sample data where TR000_1 is inserted into the atom table with element 'cl'. From the extra knowledge, 'cl' corresponds to Chlorine. So, the SQL query should fetch the element from the atom table where atom_id equals 'TR000_1'.  I don't think any joins are needed here because the information is directly in the atom table. The molecule_id might link to other tables, but since we're only after the element, it's straightforward.  So, the SQL statement should be a SELECT query targeting the 'element' column from the 'atom' table with a WHERE clause filtering by atom_id = 'TR000_1'.  I just need to ensure that the syntax is correct. Using single quotes around the string literals for atom_id and case sensitivity isn't an issue here since the data uses lowercase, but SQL might be case-insensitive depending on the configuration.  No need for any joins or subqueries; it's a simple SELECT with a WHERE condition. </think>  SELECT element FROM atom WHERE atom_id = 'TR000_1'
SELECT label FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id = 'TR000'; 
SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN bond_type = '-' THEN bond_id END) / COUNT(bond_id)) * 100 FROM bond; 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) FROM molecule m JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id WHERE m.label = '+' AND a.element = 'n'; 
SELECT m.molecule_id  FROM molecule m  WHERE EXISTS (     SELECT 1      FROM atom a      WHERE a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id AND a.element = 's' )  AND EXISTS (     SELECT 1      FROM bond b      WHERE b.molecule_id = m.molecule_id AND b.bond_type = '=' ); 
SELECT m.molecule_id FROM molecule m INNER JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id WHERE m.label = '-' GROUP BY m.molecule_id HAVING COUNT(a.atom_id) > 5; 
<think> Okay, so the user is asking for an SQL query that lists all elements involved in a double bond within molecule TR024. Let me break this down.  First, I need to understand what a double bond implies here. From the knowledge provided, a double bond is where bond_type is '='. So, I'll focus on bonds with that type.  Next, since we're dealing with molecule TR024, I should look at all atoms connected by these double bonds within that molecule. That means checking the 'bond' table for entries where molecule_id is TR024 and bond_type is '='.  But wait, in the provided data, there's no entry for TR024 in any of the tables. The bond with '=' is under TR001. So, if TR024 doesn't exist in the current database, the query might return nothing. However, the user still wants the SQL for TR024, so I'll proceed as if it exists.  Now, to find elements involved, I need to connect the bonds to their atoms. The 'connected' table links atom_ids to bond_ids. So, I'll join the 'bond' and 'connected' tables on bond_id to get the connected atoms.  Each double bond connects two atoms, so each bond will have two atom entries in the 'connected' table pointing to the same bond_id. Therefore, for each such bond, I can retrieve both atoms involved.  Once I have the atom_ids from 'connected', I need their corresponding elements. So, I'll join with the 'atom' table using atom_id to get the element information.  Putting it all together: 1. Select distinct elements because we don't want duplicates. 2. Start from the bond table where molecule_id is TR024 and bond_type is '='. 3. Join with connected on bond_id to get both atoms involved in each double bond. 4. Join those atom_ids with the atom table to fetch their elements.  I should also ensure that I'm only selecting unique elements, so using SELECT DISTINCT makes sense here.  So, the SQL will join these three tables appropriately and filter based on the conditions mentioned. </think>  SELECT DISTINCT T3.element FROM bond AS T1 INNER JOIN connected AS T2 ON T1.bond_id = T2.bond_id INNER JOIN atom AS T3 ON T2.atom_id = T3.atom_id WHERE T1.molecule_id = 'TR024' AND T1.bond_type = '='
SELECT m.molecule_id FROM molecule m LEFT JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id WHERE m.label = '+' GROUP BY m.molecule_id ORDER BY COUNT(a.atom_id) DESC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT      (SUM(IIF(m.label = '+', 1, 0)) / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS percentage FROM molecule m WHERE EXISTS (     SELECT 1     FROM atom a     JOIN connected c ON a.atom_id = c.atom_id OR a.atom_id = c.atom_id2     JOIN bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id     WHERE a.element = 'h' AND b.bond_type = '#'      AND a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id ); 
SELECT COUNT(molecule_id) FROM molecule WHERE label = '+'; 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT b.molecule_id) FROM bond b WHERE b.bond_type = '-' AND b.molecule_id BETWEEN 'TR004' AND 'TR010'; 
SELECT COUNT(atom_id) FROM atom WHERE molecule_id = 'TR008' AND element = 'c'; 
<think> Okay, so the user is asking me to help them write an SQL query based on their question: "What is the element with the atom ID of TR004_7 in molecule that is not carcinogenic?" Let's break this down step by step.  First, I need to understand the database schema they've provided. They have four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule. The relevant ones here are 'atom' and 'molecule'.   Looking at the 'molecule' table, each molecule has a label which indicates if it's carcinogenic or not. The note says that label '-' means non-carcinogenic. So, I need to find molecules where label is '-'.  Next, in the 'atom' table, each atom has an atom_id and element. The user wants the element of the atom with ID TR004_7. But wait, looking at the INSERT statements for the 'atom' table, they don't have an entry for TR004_7. They only go up to TR000_5. Hmm, maybe that's a typo or perhaps it's in another part not shown here. I'll proceed assuming TR004_7 exists.  So, my approach is: 1. Find all molecules where label is '-', meaning they are non-carcinogenic. 2. For each of these molecules, find atoms with atom_id = TR004_7 and get their element.  I think a JOIN between 'atom' and 'molecule' on molecule_id would work since the 'atom' table has molecule_id as a foreign key. That way, I can filter by both the molecule's label and the atom's ID.  Putting it all together, the SQL should select the element from 'atom' where the atom_id is TR004_7 and its corresponding molecule has label '-'. So, using a JOIN on molecule_id and filtering with WHERE clauses for both conditions. </think>  SELECT T1.element FROM atom AS T1 INNER JOIN molecule AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id WHERE T2.label = '-' AND T1.atom_id = 'TR004_7'
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT b.molecule_id) AS num_molecules_with_oxygen_double_bond FROM bond b JOIN connected c ON b.bond_id = c.bond_id LEFT JOIN atom a1 ON c.atom_id = a1.atom_id LEFT JOIN atom a2 ON c.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id WHERE b.bond_type = '=' AND (a1.element = 'O' OR a2.element = 'O'); 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT m.molecule_id) FROM molecule m JOIN bond b ON m.molecule_id = b.molecule_id WHERE m.label = '-' AND b.bond_type = '#'; 
SELECT T1.element, T2.bond_type  FROM atom AS T1  LEFT JOIN bond AS T2  ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id  WHERE T1.molecule_id = 'TR002'; 
SELECT DISTINCT a.atom_id FROM molecule m INNER JOIN atom a ON m.molecule_id = a.molecule_id INNER JOIN connected c ON a.atom_id = c.atom_id INNER JOIN bond b ON c.bond_id = b.bond_id WHERE m.molecule_id = 'TR012'   AND a.element = 'c'   AND b.bond_type = '=' 
<think> Alright, let's tackle this SQL problem step by step. The user wants me to list the atom IDs from a carcinogenic molecule that contains oxygen.   First, I need to understand the database schema and the data provided. There are four tables: atom, bond, connected, and molecule.  The molecule table has a column 'label' where '+' indicates carcinogenic molecules. So, my first step is to identify which molecules are carcinogenic by selecting those with label = '+'.  Next, I need to find atoms in these molecules that contain oxygen. The atom table has an 'element' column, so I'll look for rows where element = 'o'.  Now, since each atom belongs to a molecule via the molecule_id foreign key, I can link the atom and molecule tables on this field. However, because the molecule might have multiple atoms, but we only need those where at least one atom is oxygen, I should use a JOIN or a subquery.  Wait, actually, using an INNER JOIN would be appropriate here. I'll join the atom table with the molecule table on molecule_id. This way, I can filter for molecules that are carcinogenic and have atoms with element 'o'.  I need to make sure that the query selects distinct atom_ids in case there are multiple oxygen atoms in a molecule, but the user just wants each ID once.  Putting it all together, I'll select the atom_id from the atom table where the molecule is carcinogenic (label '+') and the atom's element is 'o'. This should give me exactly what the user is asking for. </think>  SELECT DISTINCT T1.atom_id FROM atom AS T1 INNER JOIN molecule AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id WHERE T2.label = '+' AND T1.element = 'o'
SELECT * FROM cards WHERE cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL; 
SELECT * FROM cards WHERE borderColor IS NULL AND (cardKingdomFoilId IS NULL OR cardKingdomId IS NULL); 
SELECT name, MAX(faceConvertedManaCost) AS max_face_converted_mana  FROM cards  GROUP BY name; 
SELECT name  FROM cards  WHERE frameVersion = '2015' AND edhrecRank < 100; 
SELECT c.name  FROM cards c  INNER JOIN legalities l  ON c.uuid = l.uuid  WHERE c.rarity = 'mythic' AND l.format = 'gladiator' AND l.status = 'Banned'; 
<think> Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me break it down step by step.  First, the user wants information about artifact type cards that don't have multiple faces and their legalities in the vintage format.   Looking at the database schema, the main tables involved are 'cards' and 'legalities'. The 'cards' table has all the card details, including whether a card is an artifact and if it has multiple faces. The 'legalities' table holds information about each card's status in various formats.  The user specified that an artifact card is one where the type is 'Artifact', so I'll need to filter on `type = 'Artifact'`. Also, cards without multiple faces are those where the `side` column is NULL because if a card has multiple faces, it would have some value there.  Next, for legalities in vintage format, I need to check the 'legalities' table where `format = 'vintage'` and the status is 'Legal'.   So, I'll join the 'cards' and 'legalities' tables on their shared UUID. This ensures that each card's legal status is correctly matched.  I should select the necessary columns: the card's name, its UUID (to ensure it's unique), and its vintage legality status. Using DISTINCT will help avoid duplicate entries if a card has multiple related records.  Putting it all together, I'll write an INNER JOIN between 'cards' and 'legalities', apply the filters for artifact type, no multiple faces, and vintage format with legal status. </think>  SELECT DISTINCT c.name, c.uuid, l.status AS vintage_legality FROM cards c INNER JOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid WHERE c.type = 'Artifact' AND c.side IS NULL AND l.format = 'vintage' AND l.status = 'Legal';
SELECT DISTINCT c.id, c.artist FROM cards c INNER JOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid WHERE c.power IN ('*', NULL) AND l.format = 'commander' AND l.status = 'Legal'; 
SELECT c.id FROM cards c WHERE LOWER(c.artist) = 'stephen daniel' AND c.hasContentWarning = 1 AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM rulings r WHERE r.uuid = c.uuid); 
SELECT text FROM rulings INNER JOIN cards ON rulings.uuid = cards.uuid WHERE cards.name = 'Sublime Epiphany' AND cards.number = '74s'; 
SELECT c.name, c.artist, c.isPromo FROM cards c JOIN (     SELECT uuid, COUNT(*) as ruling_count     FROM rulings     GROUP BY uuid ) r ON c.uuid = r.uuid ORDER BY r.ruling_count DESC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT fd.language FROM foreign_data fd JOIN cards c ON fd.uuid = c.uuid WHERE LOWER(c.name) = 'annul' AND c.number = '29'; 
SELECT c.name FROM cards c INNER JOIN foreign_data f ON c.uuid = f.uuid WHERE f.language = 'Japanese'; 
SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN language = 'Chinese Simplified' THEN id ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(id)) * 100 FROM set_translations; 
<think> Okay, so I have this problem where I need to write an SQL query that lists all the sets available in Italian translation along with the total number of cards per set. Let me break down how I would approach this.  First, I need to understand the database schema. From what's given, there are a few tables involved: `sets`, `set_translations`, and maybe others like `cards` or `legalities`. But for this specific question, I think the main focus is on `sets` and `set_translations`.  The `set_translations` table probably links to the `sets` table through the setCode. Each entry in `set_translations` has a setCode, language, and translation. So, if I want sets that have an Italian translation, I need to find all records in `set_translations` where the language is 'Italian'. Then, for each of those setCodes, I can get the corresponding totalSetSize from the `sets` table.  Wait, but looking at the schema again, the `sets` table has a column called 'totalSetSize' which is exactly what we need—the total number of cards per set. So my plan is to join these two tables on setCode and filter for where language is Italian.  I should use an INNER JOIN because I only want sets that have both a translation in Italian and exist in the `sets` table. Using LEFT or RIGHT joins might include sets without translations, which isn't what we need here.  So, the steps are:  1. Select setCode and totalSetSize from the `sets` table. 2. Join with the `set_translations` table on setCode. 3. Filter where language is 'Italian'. 4. Group by setCode to ensure each set is listed once if there are multiple translations, but I don't think that's necessary since each setCode in `set_translations` would have one entry per language.  Wait, actually, the problem says "list all the sets available in Italian translation." So each set might appear only once with its totalSetSize. Therefore, joining on setCode and filtering for 'Italian' should suffice without needing to group.  Putting it together, I'll write a SELECT statement that joins `sets` and `set_translations` on setCode, includes totalSetSize from sets, and where the language is Italian. The result will be each set with its code translated into Italian and the number of cards in that set.  I think I should alias the tables to make it clearer—maybe s for sets and st for set_translations. Then, select s.totalSetSize and st.translation as the name of the set in Italian. Wait, no, the problem says "list all the sets available in Italian translation." So perhaps we need both the original code (like '10E') and its Italian name, along with totalSetSize.  Wait, looking back at the sample data in `set_translations`, each entry has setCode as a code like '10E' and translation as the full name. So to list all sets available in Italian, we need their translated names and the size.  So maybe the SELECT should include st.translation AS setNameItalian and s.totalSetSize. But wait, does it need both the code and the translated name? The problem says "list all the sets," so perhaps just the translated name is enough, but to get totalSetSize, we have to join on setCode.  But in any case, I think the correct approach is to select s.totalSetSize and st.translation from both tables where language is Italian. So the SQL would be:  SELECT s.totalSetSize, st.translation FROM sets s INNER JOIN set_translations st ON s.code = st.setCode WHERE st.language = 'Italian';  Wait, but in the sample data for `set_translations`, each entry has a setCode and translation. For example, setCode '10E' is translated as 'Dixième édition' for French, etc. So when we filter on language 'Italian', we get the Italian translations of the sets.  Thus, this query should return the totalSetSize (number of cards) for each set that has an Italian translation.  I think that's it. Let me write it without any comments as per instructions. </think>  SELECT s.totalSetSize, st.translation  FROM sets s INNER JOIN set_translations st ON s.code = st.setCode WHERE st.language = 'Italian';
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT type)  FROM cards  WHERE artist = 'Aaron Boyd'; 
<think> Alright, let's tackle this SQL problem step by step. The user wants to find the keyword associated with the card named 'Angel of Mercy'.   First, I need to identify where the card names and their keywords are stored. From the provided schema, the `cards` table contains a column called `name` which holds the card names, and another column `keywords` where the keywords are stored.  So, the plan is to select the `keywords` from the `cards` table where the `name` is 'Angel of Mercy'.   I should check if there might be multiple entries for this name, but since each card's `uuid` is unique, it's safe to assume that the name will correspond to a single record. However, using `LIMIT 1` ensures we only get one result.  Putting it all together, the SQL query would select the keywords from the cards table where the name matches 'Angel of Mercy' and limit the results to just one entry. </think>  To find the keyword for the card 'Angel of Mercy', we'll look in the `cards` table where the `name` is 'Angel of Mercy'.  **Answer:**  SELECT keywords FROM cards WHERE name = 'Angel of Mercy' LIMIT 1
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE power = '*'; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query to determine the type of promotion for the card named 'Duress'. Let's break this down step by step.  First, I know that the relevant information is stored in the `cards` table because each card has various attributes, including its name and promotion types. The user mentioned that the "type of promotion" refers to the `promoTypes` field in the database schema provided.  Looking at the database schema for the `cards` table, I see that it indeed includes a column named `promoTypes`. So my goal is to retrieve this value where the card's name is 'Duress'.  Next, I need to construct an SQL query that selects the `promoTypes` from the `cards` table. The basic structure of such a query would be:  SELECT promoTypes FROM cards WHERE name = 'Duress';  I should make sure that the column names and table name match exactly as they are in the schema. In this case, the table is named `cards`, and the column is `promoTypes`.  I also need to consider if there might be multiple entries for a card named 'Duress'. However, typically, each card name is unique within a database unless there are different editions or sets. But since the question specifically asks for the promo type of 'Duress', I can assume that it's looking for any entry where the name matches exactly.  Another thing to consider is case sensitivity. SQL can be case-sensitive depending on the configuration, so ensuring that 'Duress' is correctly capitalized as per the database entries is important. If there are variations, I might need to use functions to handle case insensitivity, but without more information, I'll proceed with the exact match.  Putting it all together, the query should select the `promoTypes` from `cards` where the name is 'Duress'. This should give me the type of promotion associated with that card. </think>  To find the promotion type for the card named 'Duress', we need to query the `promoTypes` field in the `cards` table.  **Answer:** SELECT promoTypes FROM cards WHERE name = 'Duress';
SELECT borderColor FROM cards WHERE name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the user's question: "What is the type of the card 'Ancestor's Chosen' as originally printed?"   First, let me break down the problem. The user is asking for a specific piece of information about a card in a database. The key points here are:  1. **Card Name**: The card's name is "Ancestor's Chosen". 2. **Type**: They're specifically interested in the type as originally printed. From the extra knowledge provided, I know that this refers to the column `originalType` in the `cards` table.  So, my task is to retrieve the value from the `originalType` column where the card's name matches "Ancestor's Chosen".  Looking at the database schema, the relevant table here is `cards`, which contains all the information about each card, including their original types. The columns I need are:  - `name`: To identify the correct card. - `originalType`: To get the type as originally printed.  I should structure my SQL query to select `originalType` from the `cards` table where the `name` is exactly "Ancestor's Chosen". Since this name is unique (as per typical card databases), I can expect a single result, but the query will still work even if there are multiple entries by using exact matching.  I also need to consider SQL syntax. The SELECT statement should specify the column I want, the FROM clause specifies the table, and the WHERE clause filters the rows based on the name.  Putting it all together, my query should be:  SELECT originalType FROM cards WHERE name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen';  Wait, I remember that in SQL, string literals are enclosed in single quotes. The name "Ancestor's Chosen" contains an apostrophe, which might cause issues if not properly escaped. To handle this, I can use two single quotes within the string to represent one apostrophe. So the correct way is:  'Ancestor''s Chosen'  This ensures that the SQL parser correctly interprets the string without ending the string prematurely.  So, the final query should be:  SELECT originalType FROM cards WHERE name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen';  I think this covers all the necessary parts: selecting the right column, from the correct table, with the accurate where clause to fetch the desired information. I don't see any need for joins or additional tables since all required data is in the `cards` table. </think>  SELECT originalType FROM cards WHERE name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen';

SELECT id FROM cards WHERE convertedManaCost = 0; 
<think> Alright, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "What are the card layouts of cards with the keyword 'flying'?". Let me break this down step by step.  First, I should identify which tables in the database schema contain the necessary information. The user provided several tables, including `cards`, `foreign_data`, `legalities`, `sets`, and `set_translations`. Since the question is about card layouts and keywords, both of these pieces of information are likely stored in the `cards` table.  Looking at the `cards` table structure, I see that it has a column called `layout` which holds the layout information. It also has a column named `keywords`, which probably contains the keywords associated with each card. So, my task is to find all cards where 'flying' is one of their keywords and then retrieve their layouts.  Next, I need to consider how the `keywords` column is structured. Typically, in databases, when a column can have multiple values (like multiple keywords), it's often stored as a comma-separated string or maybe as an array if the database supports it. However, without knowing the exact structure, I have to make an assumption. The safest way is to check if the `keywords` field contains 'flying' anywhere in the string.  So, my SQL query needs to select the `layout` from the `cards` table where the `keywords` column includes 'flying'. To do this, I can use a WHERE clause with a LIKE operator. The syntax would be something like `WHERE keywords LIKE '%flying%'`. This will match any record where 'flying' appears in the `keywords` string.  Putting it all together, the SQL query should select the `layout` from `cards` where `keywords` contains 'flying'. I don't think there's a need to join other tables since both pieces of information are in the same table. So, the final query would be:  SELECT layout FROM cards WHERE keywords LIKE '%flying%'  I should make sure that the syntax is correct. The percent signs (%) act as wildcards to match any characters before or after 'flying', ensuring that I capture all instances where 'flying' is part of the keywords string, regardless of other keywords present.  Wait a second, what if a card has multiple keywords? For example, if a card has 'flying, first strike', the LIKE operator will still pick it up because 'flying' is a substring. That's good. Also, I should consider case sensitivity. If the database is case-sensitive and the keyword is stored as 'Flying' with a capital F, then my query might miss those. But since the question uses lowercase 'flying', I'll proceed under the assumption that keywords are stored in lowercase or that the database isn't case-sensitive.  Another consideration: should I group by layout to avoid duplicates? The question asks for "the card layouts", which implies each unique layout, not per card. So yes, adding DISTINCT would be appropriate to get unique layouts.  So, modifying my query to include DISTINCT:  SELECT DISTINCT layout FROM cards WHERE keywords LIKE '%flying%'  This ensures that I don't get duplicate layouts in the results. That makes sense because different cards can have the same layout but with the 'flying' keyword. </think>  To find the distinct card layouts of all cards that have the 'flying' keyword, you can use the following SQL query:  SELECT DISTINCT layout FROM cards WHERE keywords LIKE '%flying%'
<think> Alright, so I need to figure out how many cards have an original type of "Summon - Angel" but their subtype isn't "Angel". Let's break this down step by step.  First, looking at the database schema, the relevant table here is `cards`. It has columns like `originalType` and `subtypes`. The user wants to count rows where `originalType` is exactly "Summon - Angel", and the `subtypes` column doesn't contain just "Angel".  Wait, but how are subtypes stored? Are they stored as a single string or multiple values? In the schema, `subtypes` is a TEXT type, so I'm assuming it's a comma-separated list or maybe a single value. If it's a list, I might need to use string functions to check if "Angel" is present.  But the problem says to consider subtypes other than "Angel", which implies that any card where the subtype isn't exactly "Angel". So even if it has multiple subtypes, as long as one of them isn't "Angel", it should be counted? Or does it mean that none of the subtypes can be "Angel"?  Wait, no. The question is to find cards where the original type is "Summon - Angel" and their subtype is anything other than "Angel". So if a card has subtypes like "Angel, SomethingElse", would that count because not all are "Angel"? Or does it need to have no "Angel" at all in subtypes?  I think the intention is that any card where its original type is exactly "Summon - Angel" and whose subtype is anything other than just "Angel". So if a card has multiple subtypes including "Angel", but also others, would it still count? Or should it exclude any card that has "Angel" in its subtypes?  Looking back at the question: "subtype other than 'Angel' refers to subtypes is not 'Angel';" So perhaps it means cards where `subtypes` column is not exactly 'Angel'. So if a card has multiple subtypes, as long as one of them isn't 'Angel', does that count? Or maybe it's considering the entire subtypes string.  Wait, no. The way it's phrased: "subtype other than 'Angel' refers to subtypes is not 'Angel';" So perhaps it means that the `subtypes` field should not be exactly 'Angel'. So if a card has subtypes like 'Angel, Something', then it's still considered as having subtype other than 'Angel'? Or does it mean that any occurrence of 'Angel' in subtypes disqualifies it?  I think the correct approach is to count all cards where `originalType` is "Summon - Angel" and `subtypes` is not exactly "Angel". So even if a card has multiple subtypes including "Angel", as long as there's another subtype, it would still be counted. But wait, no—because the problem says "subtype other than 'Angel'", which probably means that the entire `subtypes` value isn't just "Angel".  Wait, but in SQL, checking if a string is not equal to 'Angel' would include any case where it's not exactly that word. So if `subtypes` has multiple values, like 'Angel, Demon', then it wouldn't be equal to 'Angel', so it would count.  But perhaps the user wants cards where none of the subtypes are "Angel", regardless of other subtypes. But since the question says "subtype other than 'Angel'", maybe it's simply that the `subtypes` isn't exactly 'Angel'.  So, the SQL needs to select from `cards` where `originalType` is "Summon - Angel" and `subtypes` is not equal to "Angel".   Therefore, the query would be:  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE originalType = 'Summon - Angel' AND subtypes != 'Angel';  But wait, in some cases, the `subtypes` might be NULL or have multiple values. So perhaps it's better to handle that. But since the question is straightforward, maybe just checking for not equal is sufficient.  So the final SQL would count all rows where originalType is exactly "Summon - Angel" and subtypes isn't exactly "Angel". </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE originalType = 'Summon - Angel' AND subtypes != 'Angel';
SELECT id FROM cards WHERE cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL; 
SELECT id FROM cards WHERE duelDeck = 'a'; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that lists the edhrecRank for cards where the frame version is 2015. Let me break this down step by step.  First, I know the information is stored in the 'cards' table because that's where card details are kept. The columns we're interested in are 'edhrecRank' and 'frameVersion'.   So, the goal is to select the edhrecRank from the cards table where frameVersion equals 2015. That means I'll use a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause.  I should start by selecting the specific column: SELECT edhrecRank FROM cards. Then, add the condition that frameVersion must be '2015'. Wait, is frameVersion stored as a string or a number? Looking back at the data, I think it's a string because in the example provided, frameVersion was '2015' and it's enclosed in quotes. So, I'll put '2015' in quotes in the WHERE clause.  Putting it all together: SELECT edhrecRank FROM cards WHERE frameVersion = '2015'.   I don't think there are any other conditions needed because the question is straightforward—just list those ranks. Also, since each card's edhrecRank is a single value, I don't need to aggregate or group them.   Wait, should I handle cases where edhrecRank might be NULL? The question doesn't specify, so I'll assume we include all cards with frameVersion 2015 regardless of whether edhrecRank is present.  No joins are needed because everything is in the 'cards' table. So, the final SQL should just select that column with the WHERE condition. </think>  To list the EDHREC rank for cards with a frame version of 2015, you can use the following SQL query:  SELECT edhrecRank FROM cards WHERE frameVersion = '2015';

<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that calculates the percentage of legendary frame effect cards that are only available in online variations. Let me break down the problem and think through each step carefully.  First, understanding the question: The user wants the percentage of cards where the frame effect is 'legendary' and they're only available online. They mentioned that "only available in online game variations" refers to isOnlineOnly = 1, and "legendary frame effect cards" means frameEffects = 'legendary'. So I need to count how many such cards meet both conditions and then find what percentage this is of all legendary frame effect cards.  Looking at the database schema provided, the relevant table here is 'cards' because it contains the columns frameEffects and isOnlineOnly. The other tables like legalities or sets don't seem necessary for this particular query since we're only focusing on two specific fields within the cards table.  So, I need to count the number of rows where frameEffects is 'legendary' and isOnlineOnly is 1. Then, divide that by the total number of rows where frameEffects is 'legendary'. Finally, multiply by 100 to get a percentage.  Let me think about how to structure this in SQL. I can use a subquery or a CTE, but perhaps a simple conditional count within the same query would work best here. Using COUNT with CASE statements might be efficient.  Wait, actually, it's better to calculate both counts in one go. So, for the numerator, I'll count where frameEffects is 'legendary' and isOnlineOnly is 1. For the denominator, just count all rows where frameEffects is 'legendary'.  So, the SQL structure would be something like:  SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN isOnlineOnly = 1 THEN id END) / COUNT(id)) * 100 AS percentage FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'legendary';  But wait, I should make sure that both counts are only considering rows where frameEffects is 'legendary'. So the WHERE clause applies to all counts.  Alternatively, I can write it as:  SELECT      (COUNT(CASE WHEN isOnlineOnly = 1 THEN id ELSE NULL END) /       COUNT(id)) * 100 FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'legendary';  This should give me the correct percentage. Let me double-check if this makes sense.  The CASE statement inside the COUNT will count only the rows where isOnlineOnly is 1, because when the condition is met, it returns id (which is non-null), and else returns NULL, which isn't counted. The denominator counts all ids in the filtered set by frameEffects.  Yes, that should work. I don't think there's a need for subqueries or joins here since all necessary columns are in the same table. </think>  SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN isOnlineOnly = 1 THEN id END) AS REAL) / COUNT(id) * 100 FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'legendary'
SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN isStorySpotlight = 1 AND isTextless = 0 THEN id END) / COUNT(id)) * 100 AS percentage FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1; 
SELECT      c.name,     (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT fd.uuid) FROM foreign_data fd WHERE fd.language = 'Spanish') / (SELECT COUNT(uuid) FROM cards) * 100 AS spanish_percentage FROM      cards c JOIN      foreign_data fd ON c.uuid = fd.uuid WHERE      fd.language = 'Spanish' GROUP BY      c.name; 
SELECT DISTINCT language FROM set_translations WHERE setCode = (SELECT code FROM sets WHERE baseSetSize = 309); 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT st.setCode) FROM set_translations st INNER JOIN sets s ON st.setCode = s.code WHERE st.language = 'Portuguese (Brasil)' AND s.block = 'Commander'; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that lists all Creature-type cards with a legal status by their IDs. Let me break down the problem step by step.  First, I know the database has several tables: cards, foreign_data, legalities, sets, set_translations, and rulings. From the schema provided, the relevant tables here are 'cards' and 'legalities'. The 'cards' table contains information about each card, including its type, and the 'legalities' table holds the legal statuses for different formats.  The user wants cards that are of type 'Creature', so I need to look at the 'type' field in the 'cards' table. However, sometimes the type might be stored in a different column or format, but from the previous examples, it seems 'type' is the correct one. So, I should filter where type = 'Creature'.  Next, each card's legal status is in the 'legalities' table. The 'status' field there indicates if the card is legal or not. The user specified that we need cards with a legal status, so I should look for records where status = 'Legal'.   Since each card can have multiple entries in the 'legalities' table (one for each format), but we just need to know if it's legal in any format, I don't need to specify a particular format unless the user wants it. But since the question is about overall legal status, I think including any legal status is sufficient.  To link the two tables, they both have a 'uuid' field. So, I'll use an INNER JOIN on 'cards.uuid = legalities.uuid'. This way, I only get cards that have at least one legal status entry.  I need to select the card's ID, which in the 'cards' table is the 'id' field. So, my SELECT statement will be 'SELECT c.id'.  Putting it all together, the SQL should join the two tables on uuid, filter for type 'Creature' and status 'Legal'. I'll also add DISTINCT to avoid duplicates if a card has multiple legal entries.  Wait, in the initial response, I didn't use DISTINCT. Let me think: If a card is legal in multiple formats, it would appear multiple times in the result. Using DISTINCT ensures each card ID appears only once, which I believe is what the user wants since they just want a list by ID without repetition.  So, the final query will select distinct IDs from 'cards' where type is 'Creature', joined with 'legalities' where status is 'Legal'. </think>  SELECT c.id FROM cards c INNER JOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid WHERE c.type = 'Creature' AND l.status = 'Legal';
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that lists all types of cards in German. The user specified that "all types" refer to both subtypes and supertypes, and both should not be null. Also, the language in question is German.  First, I'll look at the database schema provided. There's a `cards` table which contains columns like `subtypes` and `supertypes`. These are the columns that store the card types we're interested in.   Next, the user wants the information in German, so I need to consider translations. The `set_translations` table has a column for `language`, but since the question is about card types rather than set names, maybe it's more relevant to look at the `cards` table itself or other related tables.  Wait, actually, the card details are stored in the `cards` table, and if there are translations, perhaps those are handled elsewhere. But I think that for this query, since we're focusing on subtypes and supertypes which are part of the `cards` table, maybe we don't need to join with other tables unless those columns are translated.  Wait no, the question is about listing types in German, so perhaps the subtypes and supertypes themselves are stored in the original language. So maybe I just need to retrieve them from the `cards` table where both subtypes and supertypes are not null, regardless of the language they're stored in. But the user might want them translated into German.  Wait, maybe the translations are handled elsewhere. Let me think: The `set_translations` table translates set names, but for card types, perhaps there's another table or it's part of the `cards` table. Alternatively, maybe we can assume that the subtypes and supertypes in the `cards` table are already in multiple languages, so to get them in German, we might need a different approach.  Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking for all cards where their subtypes and supertypes are not null and then display those types. But since the question specifies "in German," maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the `cards` table has these fields in the original language, so to get them in German, we might need a join with another table.  Wait, perhaps the `foreign key` references are important here. The `set_translations` table has `setCode`, but that's for sets, not individual cards. Maybe I'm supposed to get the types from the `cards` table where both subtypes and supertypes are not null, and then perhaps join with another table if translations exist.  Wait, looking back, there's a `rulings` table and a `legalities` table, but those don't seem relevant. The `foreign` table is linked via UUID to the `cards` table.  Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the user wants all types (subtypes and supertypes) in German, perhaps they just want to select from the `cards` table where both subtypes and supertypes are not null, and then display those fields. But since the data might be stored in another language, maybe I'm missing something.  Wait no, maybe the user is implying that the card types should be translated into German, so perhaps we need to join with a translations table that handles card types. But from the schema provided, there's no such table. So maybe the `cards` table only has subtypes and supertypes in one language, and the question is just about selecting where both are not null.  Alternatively, perhaps the user meant that the output should be in German, so we can select the subtypes and supertypes as they are since the database might store them in multiple languages. But without knowing how the data is stored, it's hard to say.  Wait, let me read the question again: "Lists all types of cards in German." So perhaps the output should include the subtypes and supertypes translated into German. If that's the case, then we might need a translation table for card types, but from the schema provided, there isn't one. The `set_translations` only handles set names.  Given this, maybe the best approach is to select the subtypes and supertypes from the `cards` table where both are not null, without any joins because there's no translation table available for card types. So the SQL would be:  SELECT subtypes, supertypes FROM cards WHERE subtypes IS NOT NULL AND supertypes IS NOT NULL;  But wait, the user wants it in German. Since we don't have a way to translate those fields, maybe they just want the data where both are not null, regardless of language.  Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding and the question is simply asking for all types (subtypes and supertypes) from cards where the card's name or other attributes are in German. But without more info on how language is stored, it's unclear.  Wait, maybe the `cards` table has a language field, but looking back at the schema, I don't see such a column. So perhaps the user wants to select all subtypes and supertypes where both exist, regardless of language. Therefore, the SQL would be as I wrote before. </think>  SELECT subtypes, supertypes FROM cards WHERE subtypes IS NOT NULL AND supertypes IS NOT NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM cards  WHERE (power IS NULL OR power = '*') AND LOWER(text) LIKE '%triggered ability%'; 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.uuid) FROM cards c JOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid JOIN rulings r ON c.uuid = r.uuid WHERE l.format = 'premodern'   AND l.status = 'Legal'   AND r.text LIKE '%This is a triggered mana ability.%'   AND c.side IS NULL; 
SELECT c.id  FROM cards c INNER JOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid WHERE c.artist = 'Erica Yang'    AND l.format = 'pauper'   AND l.status = 'Legal'   AND c.availability = 'paper';

<think> Alright, I need to figure out how many cards have a print rarity of 'rare' and have a ruling text printed on '2007-02-01'.   First, I know that the 'cards' table stores information about each card, including their rarity in the 'rarity' column. So, I'll start by selecting from this table where the rarity is 'rare'.  Next, each card can have rulings, which are stored in the 'rulings' table. The 'rulings' table has a 'date' column that indicates when the ruling was made and a 'text' column for the actual ruling. I need to find cards where there's at least one ruling on '2007-02-01'.   Since each card can have multiple rulings, I should join the 'cards' table with the 'rulings' table using the 'uuid' as the common key. This way, I can link each card to its rulings.  But wait, I don't want to count a card multiple times if it has more than one ruling on that date. So, I'll use the DISTINCT keyword to ensure each card is counted only once, even if it has several rulings on the same day.  Putting this all together, I'll write a SQL query that joins both tables on 'uuid', filters for rarity 'rare' and the specific date, and counts the distinct cards. </think>  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.uuid)  FROM cards c JOIN rulings r ON c.uuid = r.uuid WHERE c.rarity = 'rare' AND r.date = '2007-02-01';
SELECT st.language  FROM sets s  INNER JOIN set_translations st ON s.code = st.setCode  WHERE s.block = 'Ravnica' AND s.baseSetSize = 180; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out the SQL query for the question: "What percentage of cards with format commander and legal status do not have a content warning?"   First, let's break down what the user is asking. They want the percentage of cards that meet two criteria: they are legal in Commander format and don't have a content warning.  I remember from the database schema that there are two relevant tables: `cards` and `legalities`. The `cards` table has a column `hasContentWarning` which is an integer where 0 means no content warning. The `legalities` table links to `cards` via the `uuid` foreign key and contains information about the format and status.  So, I need to join these two tables on `uuid`. Specifically, I'll use an INNER JOIN because I'm only interested in cards that have a legal status entry for Commander.  Next, I should filter the results to only include rows where the format is 'commander' and the status is 'Legal'. That means adding a WHERE clause with those conditions.  Now, to find the percentage, I need two counts: the number of cards without a content warning (hasContentWarning = 0) and the total number of such cards in Commander with legal status. The formula for the percentage is (count_without_warning / total_count) * 100.  In SQL, I can use COUNT(CASE WHEN ... ELSE NULL END) to count specific conditions. So, I'll write two counts within a single query: one for hasContentWarning = 0 and another for all cards meeting the format and status criteria.  Putting it all together, I'll select from `legalities` and join with `cards`, apply the WHERE conditions, and compute the percentage using the two counts. Finally, I'll multiply by 100 to get the result as a percentage. </think>  SELECT      (COUNT(CASE WHEN c.hasContentWarning = 0 THEN l.id END) / COUNT(l.id)) * 100 AS percentage FROM      legalities l INNER JOIN      cards c ON l.uuid = c.uuid WHERE      l.format = 'commander' AND l.status = 'Legal';
SELECT    (COUNT(CASE WHEN fd.language = 'French' AND (c.power IS NULL OR c.power = '*') THEN c.uuid END) / COUNT(CASE WHEN c.power IS NULL OR c.power = '*' THEN c.uuid END)) * 100 AS percentage_french_without_power FROM cards c LEFT JOIN foreign_data fd ON c.uuid = fd.uuid; 
SELECT      (COUNT(CASE WHEN s.type = 'expansion' THEN st.id END) / COUNT(st.id)) * 100 AS percentage_expansion FROM      set_translations st JOIN      sets s ON st.setCode = s.code WHERE      st.language = 'Japanese'; 
<think> Alright, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "What kind of printing is on the card that Daren Bader created?" The user also provided some extra knowledge, which says that "kind of printing" refers to availability and that "Daren Bader created" means the artist is 'Daren Bader'.   First, I should look at the database schema provided. There's a table called `cards` with various columns. The relevant ones here are `artist` and `availability`. So, my goal is to select the `availability` from the `cards` table where the `artist` is 'Daren Bader'.  Wait, let me make sure I'm understanding correctly. The question is about the printing on the card created by Daren Bader, which translates to the availability field in the database. So yes, selecting `availability` makes sense.  I should structure my SQL query to select the `availability` column from the `cards` table where the `artist` equals 'Daren Bader'. Since the user wants only the SQL without any comments, I need to make sure it's clean and straightforward.  So the basic structure would be: SELECT availability FROM cards WHERE artist = 'Daren Bader';  Is there anything else I might need? Maybe check if the table or column names are case-sensitive, but in most SQL setups, they aren't unless specified. Also, ensure that the string is properly quoted with single quotes.  I think that's it. The query should return the availability information for all cards where the artist is Daren Bader. </think>  SELECT availability FROM cards WHERE artist = 'Daren Bader';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE borderColor = 'borderless' AND edhrecRank > 12000 AND colors IS NOT NULL; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE isOversized = 1 AND isReprint = 1 AND isPromo = 1; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for the top three unknown power cards that have promotional types for Arena League, and they want them listed in alphabetical order.   First, let me break down what each part means. "Unknown power cards" refers to cards where the 'power' field is either NULL or '*'. I remember from the schema that the 'cards' table has a 'power' column, so I'll need to filter on that.  Next, the promotional types for Arena League mean that the card's 'promoTypes' should be 'arenaleague'. In the 'cards' table, there's a 'promoTypes' field, but wait, looking at the schema, it's actually called 'promoTypes', which might be a string or a list. Hmm, I need to check if it's stored as a single value or multiple values. But in this case, the user specifies 'promotional types for arena league', so I'm assuming each entry is a single string like 'arenaleague'.  So, I'll need to select rows where promoTypes = 'arenaleague' and power is either NULL or '*'.   Now, the user wants the top three such cards. Since they mentioned alphabetical order, I should sort them by name. The 'name' field in the 'cards' table will be used for ordering.  Putting it all together, I'll select the card names where promoTypes is 'arenaleague', power is NULL or '*', order them alphabetically, and limit the results to three.  I also need to make sure that the SQL doesn't include any comments, just the query itself. So, the structure will be SELECT name FROM cards WHERE promoTypes = 'arenaleague' AND (power IS NULL OR power = '*') ORDER BY name LIMIT 3;.  Wait a second, I should verify if the 'promoTypes' field is a single string or if it's stored as a list of strings. If it's a list, my WHERE clause might not work correctly because checking for equality with a string would only match exact entries. But given the schema provided, it seems that 'promoTypes' is a text field, so I'll proceed under the assumption that each promoType is a single value or perhaps comma-separated. However, without more info, treating it as a single string is safer.  So, the final SQL should correctly filter and order the results as specified. </think>  SELECT name FROM cards WHERE promoTypes = 'arenaleague' AND (power IS NULL OR power = '*') ORDER BY name LIMIT 3;
SELECT language FROM foreign_data WHERE multiverseid = 149934; 
SELECT id, cardKingdomId, cardKingdomFoilId FROM cards WHERE cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY cardKingdomFoilId ASC LIMIT 3; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "What proportion of cards do not have a text box with a normal layout?"   First, let's break down the question. The user is asking for the proportion, which implies a ratio or percentage. They want to know out of all the cards that don't have a text box (isTextless = 1), how many of those also have a normal layout.  From the provided schema, I see that the 'cards' table has columns 'isTextless' and 'layout'. The 'isTextless' column is a boolean where 1 means the card doesn't have a text box. The 'layout' column indicates the card's layout type, such as 'normal', 'split', etc.  The user also provided some extra knowledge: they mentioned that the proportion should be calculated by dividing the count of cards where both isTextless = 1 and layout = 'normal' by the total number of cards where isTextless = 1. Then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.  So, my approach would be: 1. Count how many cards have isTextless = 1 AND layout = 'normal'. This will give me the numerator. 2. Count all cards that have isTextless = 1. This will be the denominator. 3. Divide the numerator by the denominator and multiply by 100 to get the proportion.  I need to make sure I'm using the correct SQL syntax for this. Since we're dealing with counts and a division, I can use a subquery or directly calculate it in the same query. However, using a subquery might not be necessary here because both counts can be retrieved in one go.  Wait, but the user wants to calculate (number of textless and normal layout) divided by (total number of textless cards). So, I'll structure the SQL to get these two counts separately and then perform the division.  I should also ensure that if there are no textless cards, we don't run into division by zero errors, but in this case, since 'isTextless' is a column with data, it's likely there are such cards, so perhaps not an issue here. But maybe adding a condition to handle zero could be safer, though the user didn't specify that.  Putting it all together, I'll write a SELECT statement that does both counts and then performs the division. Using CAST might be necessary if I want a decimal result instead of an integer.  Wait, in SQL, when you divide two integers, you get an integer unless you cast them to floats or use decimal types. So, to get a precise proportion, I should cast at least one of the counts as a float.  So, the final query would look something like:  SELECT (CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN layout = 'normal' THEN uuid ELSE NULL END) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(uuid)) * 100 FROM cards WHERE isTextless = 1;  Wait, but I think using CASE inside COUNT might not be the most straightforward way. Alternatively, I can use a subquery or a CTE (Common Table Expression), but since it's a single table, maybe it's better to keep it simple.  Alternatively, another approach is:  SELECT ((COUNT(layout = 'normal') * 1.0) / COUNT(*)) * 100 FROM cards WHERE isTextless = 1;  But in SQL, COUNT(layout = 'normal') isn't valid syntax because COUNT expects an expression that evaluates to a boolean, but it's actually counting the number of rows where layout equals 'normal' and not null.  Wait, no, actually, COUNT(column) counts non-null values. So if I do COUNT(CASE WHEN layout = 'normal' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END), that would count how many times layout is normal. Alternatively, using a conditional count with SUM.  Alternatively, perhaps it's clearer to write:  SELECT (COUNT(layout = 'normal') * 100.0) / COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE isTextless = 1;  But wait, in SQL, the expression COUNT(layout = 'normal') isn't standard because COUNT takes a column name or an expression that evaluates to a value. So perhaps using SUM with a CASE statement would be better.  So, the correct way would be:  SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN layout = 'normal' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0) / COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE isTextless = 1;  This will sum up 1 for each row where layout is normal and isTextless is 1, then multiply by 100 and divide by the total count of rows where isTextless is 1.  Yes, that makes sense. So this should give the proportion as a percentage. </think>  SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN layout = 'normal' THEN uuid ELSE NULL END) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(uuid) * 100 FROM cards WHERE isTextless = 1
<think> Okay, I need to solve this SQL problem. Let me read the user's question carefully.  The question is asking for the card numbers that meet two conditions: 1. They don't have multiple faces on a single card. 2. Their subtypes include both Angel and Wizard.  First, I'll look at the database schema provided. The main table here is `cards`, which has several columns.   For the first condition, "don't have multiple faces," I remember that in Magic: The Gathering, cards with multiple faces usually have a 'side' column indicating they are split or flip cards. But the user mentioned an extra tip: to check if 'side' is null, meaning it's a single-faced card. So, I'll use `side IS NULL` in my WHERE clause.  Next, for the subtypes, each card has a 'subtypes' field which might be stored as a string containing multiple types separated by commas or another delimiter. Since we need both Angel and Wizard, I have to ensure that both are present in the subtypes. However, SQL doesn't support array operations natively, so I'll use string functions.  I think using `LIKE` with wildcard operators is the way to go. So, I'll check if 'Angel' exists somewhere in the subtypes and 'Wizard' also exists. That means two separate conditions connected by an AND: `subtypes LIKE '%Angel%'` and `subtypes LIKE '%Wizard%'`.  Putting it all together, I need to select the 'number' column from the `cards` table where both conditions are met.  Wait, let me double-check if 'side IS NULL' correctly identifies single-faced cards. Yes, because in the `cards` table, 'side' being null means there's only one face on the card. So that part is correct.  I should also consider case sensitivity. Depending on the database, the LIKE operator might be case-sensitive. But since the user didn't specify, I'll assume the data uses a standard case, and my query will match accordingly.  So the final SQL would select 'number' from `cards` where 'side' is null and both subtypes are present. </think>  SELECT number FROM cards WHERE side IS NULL AND subtypes LIKE '%Angel%' AND subtypes LIKE '%Wizard%';
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's request. Let me break down what they're asking for.  The question is: "Please provide top three sets that don't appear in Magic: The Gathering Online, along with their names in alphabetical order."  First, I should understand what "don't appear in Magic: The Gathering Online" means. From the extra knowledge provided, it refers to cases where either mtgoCode is NULL or an empty string (''). So, in the `sets` table, I need to filter records where the mtgoCode column meets these conditions.  Next, the user wants the top three such sets. Since they mentioned ordering by names alphabetically, I should sort the results by the set's name in ascending order and then limit the output to the first three entries.  Looking at the `sets` table structure, it has columns like code, name, mtgoCode, etc. So, my SELECT statement will target the 'name' column since that's what the user wants to display.  I'll start by selecting the name from the sets table where mtgoCode is either NULL or an empty string. Then, I'll order these names alphabetically using the ORDER BY clause with ASC (ascending) to ensure it's in alphabetical order. Finally, I'll apply a LIMIT of 3 to get only the top three results.  Putting this together, my SQL should look like: SELECT name FROM sets WHERE mtgoCode IS NULL OR mtgoCode = '' ORDER BY name ASC LIMIT 3;  I think that covers all parts of the question: filtering the correct sets, ordering them alphabetically, and limiting to three. I don't see any other conditions or joins needed here since the information is all within the `sets` table. </think>  SELECT name FROM sets WHERE mtgoCode IS NULL OR mtgoCode = '' ORDER BY name ASC LIMIT 3
SELECT st.language  FROM sets s INNER JOIN set_translations st ON s.code = st.setCode WHERE s.mcmName = 'Archenemy' AND s.code = 'ARC'; 
SELECT s.name, st.language, st.translation  FROM sets s  INNER JOIN set_translations st  ON s.code = st.setCode  WHERE s.id = 5; 
SELECT st.language, s.type  FROM sets s  INNER JOIN set_translations st  ON s.code = st.setCode  WHERE s.id = 206; 
SELECT s.id, st.translation  FROM sets s  INNER JOIN set_translations st  ON s.code = st.setCode  WHERE s.block = 'Shadowmoor' AND st.language = 'Italian' ORDER BY st.translation  LIMIT 2; 
SELECT s.id  FROM sets s  INNER JOIN set_translations st ON s.code = st.setCode  WHERE s.isForeignOnly = 1 AND s.isFoilOnly = 1 AND st.language = 'Japanese'; 
SELECT s.name, st.translation, s.baseSetSize FROM sets s INNER JOIN set_translations st ON s.code = st.setCode WHERE st.language = 'Russian' ORDER BY s.baseSetSize DESC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT      (COUNT(CASE WHEN isOnlineOnly = 1 THEN id ELSE NULL END) * 1.0) / COUNT(*) AS proportion FROM cards WHERE language = 'Chinese Simplified'; 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT st.setcode) FROM set_translations st INNER JOIN sets s ON st.setcode = s.code WHERE st.language = 'Japanese'   AND (s.mtgoCode IS NULL OR s.mtgoCode = ''); 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE borderColor = 'black'; SELECT id FROM cards WHERE borderColor = 'black'; 
SELECT id FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart'; 
SELECT * FROM cards WHERE borderColor = 'black' AND isFullArt = 1;

SELECT name FROM sets WHERE code = 'ALL'; 
SELECT f.language  FROM cards c  JOIN foreign_data f ON c.uuid = f.uuid  WHERE c.name = 'A Pedra Fellwar'; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that finds the set code for a set released on 07/13/2007. Let me start by understanding the database schema provided.  Looking at the tables, the 'sets' table seems relevant because it contains information about different sets, including release dates. The columns in the 'sets' table include 'releaseDate', which is a DATE type, and 'code', which is what I'm trying to find.  So, my goal is to select the 'code' from the 'sets' table where the 'releaseDate' matches July 13, 2007.   I should consider the date format in SQL. Typically, dates are written as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. So, July 13, 2007 would be '2007-07-13'.  Putting it together, I'll use a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause to filter by that specific date. The query will look like this: select code from sets where releaseDate = '2007-07-13';  I don't think any joins are necessary here since all the information is in one table. Also, there's no need for additional conditions because we're only looking for a specific date.  I should double-check if the 'releaseDate' column stores dates in that format and if it's possible for multiple sets to have the same release date. If so, this query will return all matching set codes. But since the question asks for the set code, I assume there's either one or it's acceptable to get all.  So, the final SQL should be straightforward. </think>  SELECT code FROM sets WHERE releaseDate = '2007-07-13';
<think> Okay, so I need to write an SQL query for the following question: "Mention the base set size and set code of the set that was in block named 'Masques' and 'Mirage'." Let me break this down step by step.  First, I should understand what each part of the question is asking. The user wants information about sets that belong to two specific blocks: Masques and Mirage. They need the base set size and the set code for these sets.  Looking at the database schema provided, the relevant table here is `sets`. This table has columns like `block`, `baseSetSize`, and `code`, which are exactly what I need. So my query will focus on this table.  The key is to filter the rows where the `block` column matches either 'Masques' or 'Mirage'. In SQL, I can achieve this by using the OR operator in the WHERE clause.  So the basic structure of the query would be selecting `baseSetSize` and `code` from the `sets` table where the block is either Masques or Mirage. That translates to:  SELECT baseSetSize, code FROM sets WHERE block = 'Masques' OR block = 'Mirage';  I should make sure that the column names are correctly spelled as per the schema. Also, the string values for the blocks need to be exactly matched, so I'll use single quotes around them.  Another consideration is whether the user wants both sets in one query or separate. Since they mentioned both Masques and Mirage, using OR makes sense because it fetches all sets that belong to either block in a single query.  I don't think there's any need for joins here since all required information is within the `sets` table. Also, no aggregations are needed unless the user wants combined data, but they seem to want individual set details.  So putting it all together, the SQL statement should select the two columns from the sets where the block is either of those two names. </think>  SELECT baseSetSize, code FROM sets WHERE block = 'Masques' OR block = 'Mirage';
<think> Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the SQL query for the user's question.  First, the user asked for the code of sets that have an expansion type of 'expansion'. From the provided schema, I know that set information is stored in the `sets` table. The column `type` in this table likely indicates the type of set, such as 'expansion', 'core', etc.  The user also mentioned that the code of sets refers to `setCode`, which is a column in the `sets` table. So my goal is to select the `code` from `sets` where the `type` is 'expansion'.  I considered whether there might be additional conditions, but since the question doesn't specify any other criteria, I focused solely on the `type` column matching 'expansion'.   I made sure to use the correct syntax, selecting `code` and using a WHERE clause to filter by type. No joins were necessary because all required information is within the `sets` table.  Finally, I wrote the SQL query without any comments as per the user's instruction. </think>  SELECT code FROM sets WHERE type = 'expansion'
SELECT      name AS foreign_name,     type FROM      cards WHERE      watermark = 'Boros'; 
SELECT fd.language, fd.flavorText, c.type  FROM cards c  INNER JOIN foreign_data fd  ON c.uuid = fd.uuid  WHERE c.watermark = 'colorpie'; 
SELECT      (COUNT(CASE WHEN c.convertedManaCost = 10 THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(*)) * 100 AS PercentageOfCMC10 FROM      cards c INNER JOIN      sets s ON c.setCode = s.code WHERE      s.name = 'Abyssal Horror'; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that gives me the codes of sets where the type is 'expansion' and also have a 'commander' type. Let's start by looking at the database schema provided.  First, the user mentioned that "code of sets refers to setCode," which means I should focus on the `sets` table since it contains the `code` column as setCode. The other tables like `cards`, `foreign_data`, and `legalities` don't seem directly relevant here unless I need to join them, but the question is specifically about set codes based on type.  Now, looking at the `sets` table structure, it has a `type` column which likely indicates what kind of set it is. The user wants sets that are both 'expansion' and have something related to 'commander'. I'm assuming that 'expansion' is one possible value for the `type` column.  But wait, does the `sets` table include a 'commander' type? Or maybe the 'commander' part comes from another table. Hmm, perhaps I need to check if there's any relation to the `legalities` table or elsewhere. However, upon reviewing, the `legalities` table links to cards, not sets, so that might not be directly helpful here.  Alternatively, maybe each set can have multiple types, but looking at the schema, it seems each set has a single type in the `type` column. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the user wrote "have expansion commander type." Maybe they mean the set's type is both 'expansion' and somehow related to 'commander', like maybe 'commander' is part of the type or another column.  Looking again at the `sets` table, the possible types might include things like 'core', 'expansion', 'draft', etc. So if a set has a type that includes both expansion and commander aspects, perhaps it's in the type string as something like 'commander' or maybe there's a specific value.  Wait, perhaps the user is referring to sets that are expansions specifically for Commander format. But I don't see a direct field indicating that. Alternatively, perhaps the `type` column includes both expansion and commander info somehow.  Alternatively, maybe the set's type is 'expansion', and we're just looking for all such sets without any further filtering. But then why mention 'commander'? Maybe there's another way to link it.  Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The user wants set codes where the set type is expansion and maybe also have some relation to commander, but since the schema doesn't directly support that, perhaps the answer is simply to select sets where type is 'expansion'.  Wait no, because the example in `set_translations` shows setCode like '10E' with translations. Maybe the user wants all expansion sets regardless of other factors. Since the question isn't very clear on how commander comes into play, but based on the extra knowledge that code refers to setCode and considering the provided tables, perhaps the intended answer is just selecting all sets where type is 'expansion'.  So the SQL query would be:  SELECT code FROM sets WHERE type = 'expansion';  I think that's it. Since there's no clear way to link commander to the sets table beyond possibly the type being expansion and maybe some other attribute, but without more info, this should suffice. </think>  SELECT code FROM sets WHERE type = 'expansion';
SELECT T2.name, T1.type  FROM cards AS T1 INNER JOIN foreign_data AS T2  ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.watermark = 'abzan'; 
SELECT fd.language, c.type  FROM cards c  JOIN foreign_data fd ON c.uuid = fd.uuid  WHERE c.watermark = 'Azorius'; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE artist = 'Aaron Miller' AND cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE availability LIKE '%paper%' AND hand = '3'; 
SELECT name FROM cards WHERE isTextless = 0; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that finds the unconverted mana cost of the card named "Ancestor's Chosen". Let me break this down step by step.  First, looking at the database schema provided, there are several tables: cards, foreign_data, legalities, sets, set_translations, and rulings. Since I'm looking for a specific card's mana cost, I should focus on the 'cards' table because it contains all the relevant information about each card, including name and manaCost.  The user has specified that "Ancestor's Chosen" refers to where the 'name' column is exactly 'Ancestor`s Chosen'. Wait, in SQL, backticks are used for column names if they have spaces or special characters. But in this case, when comparing strings, I should make sure the string matches exactly. So the WHERE clause should be name = 'Ancestor's Chosen'.  Wait, no, looking again, the user clarified that "Ancestor's Chosen" is stored as name = 'Ancestor`s Chosen'. That might mean that in the database, the apostrophe is escaped with a backtick or something else. Hmm, sometimes in SQL, to include an apostrophe in a string, you use two apostrophes. So maybe the correct way to write it is 'Ancestor''s Chosen'.  But wait, the user instruction says: card "Ancestor's Chosen" refers to name = 'Ancestor`s Chosen'. That might mean that in the database, the name is stored with backticks around the apostrophe? Or perhaps they meant that in the code. Wait, no, in SQL, when you write a string, if it contains an apostrophe, you need to escape it by using two apostrophes.  So the correct way would be to have WHERE name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'.  But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The user said that "Ancestor's Chosen" refers to name = 'Ancestor`s Chosen'. So perhaps in the database, it's stored with a backslash before the apostrophe? Or maybe the user just used backticks for code formatting.  Wait, no, in SQL, using backticks is for column names that have spaces or special characters. The string itself should be enclosed in single quotes, and any apostrophe inside should be escaped by doubling them up.  So to correctly get "Ancestor's Chosen", the WHERE clause should be name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'.  But let me confirm: if I write it as name = 'Ancestor's Chosen', that would cause a syntax error because the string isn't properly closed. So yes, escaping is necessary.  So putting that together, the SELECT statement should retrieve manaCost from the cards table where the name matches 'Ancestor''s Chosen'.  Wait, but looking back at the user's exact instruction: they wrote "name = 'Ancestor`s Chosen'". Using backticks in strings isn't standard SQL; it's more for code formatting. So perhaps I should just use single quotes and escape any apostrophes.  Therefore, the correct WHERE clause is name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'.  So the SQL query would be:  SELECT manaCost FROM cards WHERE name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen';  This selects the manaCost column from the cards table where the name is exactly "Ancestor's Chosen", with the apostrophe properly escaped.  I think that covers it. I don't need to join any other tables because all the necessary information is in the 'cards' table. </think>  SELECT manaCost FROM cards WHERE name = 'Ancestor`s Chosen';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards  WHERE borderColor = 'white' AND (power = '*' OR power IS NULL); 
SELECT name FROM cards WHERE isPromo = 1 AND side IS NOT NULL; 
SELECT subtypes, supertypes FROM cards WHERE name = 'Molimo, Maro-Sorcerer'; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The task is to list the websites where one can buy cards that have a promotional type of "bundle".   First, I'll look at the database schema provided. There are several tables: `cards`, `foreign_data`, `legalities`, `sets`, `set_translations`, and `rulings`. The relevant columns for this query seem to be in the `cards` table.  The user mentioned that promotional type "bundle" refers to `promoTypes = 'bundle'`. So, I need to filter the cards where `promoTypes` is 'bundle'.   Next, the websites are referred to as `purchaseUrls`, which is a column in the `cards` table. My goal is to retrieve this URL for each card that meets the promo type condition.  Since each row in the `cards` table represents a different card, and I want all such URLs, I should select the `purchaseUrls` from `cards` where `promoTypes` equals 'bundle'.   I also need to consider whether multiple entries might exist for the same URL. If the user wants unique websites, I would use `DISTINCT`, but since they just asked to list them, including all occurrences is probably acceptable unless specified otherwise.  Putting it together, the SQL query should select `purchaseUrls` from `cards` where `promoTypes` is 'bundle'.   I should make sure that the syntax is correct. The column names are case-sensitive as per the schema, so I'll use the exact casing provided: `promoTypes` and `purchaseUrls`. Also, string comparisons in SQL are usually case-insensitive, but it's safer to match the exact case unless specified otherwise.  So, the final query would be selecting the required column from `cards` with the appropriate condition. </think>  SELECT purchaseUrls FROM cards WHERE promoTypes = 'bundle'
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT artist)  FROM cards  WHERE border = 'Black' AND availability LIKE '%arena%' AND availability LIKE '%mtgo%'; 
SELECT name, convertedManaCost  FROM cards  WHERE name = 'Serra Angel' OR name = 'Shrine Keeper'; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that finds the artist who designed the card with the promotional name "Battra, Dark Destroyer". Let me break this down step by step.  First, I know from the problem statement that the promotional name refers to the 'flavorName' field in the database. So, I should look for a row where flavorName is exactly "Battra, Dark Destroyer".  The table we're dealing with here is the 'cards' table since it contains information about each card, including the artist and flavorName.  So, my goal is to select the artist from the cards table where the flavorName matches "Battra, Dark Destroyer".   I should structure the SQL query using a SELECT statement. The basic structure would be:  SELECT artist FROM cards WHERE flavorName = 'Battra, Dark Destroyer';  That seems straightforward. I don't think there are any joins needed here because all the necessary information is in the same table.  Wait, let me double-check the column names from the provided schema to ensure I'm using the correct ones. Yes, the 'cards' table does have a column named 'artist' and another named 'flavorName'.  Is there any possibility that flavorName could be null or that multiple entries might have the same flavorName? If so, maybe the query should handle that, but since the question is specific to one card, I think it's safe as is.  I don't see any need for additional conditions or joins. The foreign keys and other tables like 'legalities' or 'foreign' aren't relevant here because we're only dealing with the artist and flavorName in the same table.  So, my final SQL query should simply select the artist from cards where flavorName is "Battra, Dark Destroyer". </think>  SELECT artist FROM cards WHERE flavorName = 'Battra, Dark Destroyer';
SELECT name  FROM cards  WHERE frameVersion = '2003'  ORDER BY convertedManaCost DESC  LIMIT 3; 
SELECT st.translation  FROM cards c JOIN set_translations st ON c.setCode = st.setCode WHERE c.name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen' AND st.language = 'Italian'; 
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM set_translations  WHERE setCode = (SELECT setCode FROM cards WHERE name = 'Angel of Mercy'); 
SELECT name  FROM cards  WHERE setCcode = '10E'; 
SELECT fd.* FROM cards c JOIN foreign_data fd ON c.uuid = fd.uuid WHERE c.name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen' AND fd.language = 'Korean'; 
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM cards  WHERE artist = 'Adam Rex' AND setCode = '10E'; 
SELECT s.baseSetSize  FROM sets s  INNER JOIN set_translations st  ON s.code = st.setCode  WHERE st.translation = 'Hauptset Zehnte Edition'; 
SELECT st.translation  FROM sets s INNER JOIN set_translations st ON s.code = st.setCode WHERE s.name = 'Eighth Edition' AND st.language = 'Chinese Simplified'; 
SELECT c.name, s.mtgoCode  FROM cards c  INNER JOIN sets s ON c.setCode = s.code  WHERE c.name = 'Angel of Mercy' AND s.mtgoCode IS NOT NULL; 
SELECT s.releaseDate  FROM cards c  INNER JOIN sets s  ON c.setCode = s.code  WHERE c.name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'; 
SELECT s.type  FROM sets s  INNER JOIN set_translations st  ON s.code = st.setCode  WHERE st.translation = 'Hauptset Zehnte Edition'; 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.code)  FROM sets s  JOIN set_translations st ON s.code = st.setcode  WHERE s.block = 'Ice Age' AND st.language = 'Italian' AND st.translation IS NOT NULL; 
SELECT s.isForeignOnly  FROM cards c  JOIN sets s ON c.setCode = s.code  WHERE c.name = 'Adarkar Valkyrie'; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM set_translations st INNER JOIN sets s ON st.setCode = s.code WHERE st.language = 'Italian' AND s.baseSetSize < 100; 
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM cards  WHERE set_name = 'Coldsnap' AND border_color = 'black'; 
SELECT c.* FROM cards c JOIN sets s ON c.set_id = s.id WHERE s.name = 'Coldsnap' ORDER BY c.convertedManaCost DESC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT DISTINCT c.artist FROM cards c JOIN sets s ON c.PrintedSetCode = s.code WHERE s.name = 'Coldsnap'; 
SELECT c.* FROM cards c INNER JOIN sets s ON c.setCode = s.code WHERE s.name = 'Coldsnap' AND c.number = 4; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how many cards in the Coldsnap set have a converted mana cost greater than 5 and an unknown power. Let me break this down step by step.  First, I know that each card belongs to a set, and the set's name is 'Coldsnap'. The cards table has a field called 'setCode', which probably references the code of the set in the sets table. So I need to join the cards table with the sets table on this setCode to get the set's name.  Wait, actually, looking at the tables, the sets table has a 'code' column and a 'name' column. But in the cards table, there's no direct set name; instead, it might have a 'setCode'. So I should join cards with sets where cards.setCode equals sets.code, and then filter where sets.name is 'Coldsnap'.  Next, the converted mana cost part is straightforward. The cards table has a 'convertedManaCost' column, so I'll need to include cards where this value is greater than 5.  Now, for the unknown power. The user mentioned that an unknown power is when the 'power' field is either '*' or null. So in SQL terms, I need to check if power IS NULL or equals '*'.  Putting it all together, my query should select from the cards table, join with sets on setCode and code respectively, filter for sets where name is 'Coldsnap', convertedManaCost > 5, and power is either null or '*'. Finally, I just need to count how many such rows exist.  Wait, do I need to handle any potential issues? Like if multiple entries in the sets table have the same code but different names? Probably not, since each setCode should correspond to one set with a unique name. Also, make sure that the join is correctly on cards.setcode = sets.code and sets.name = 'Coldsnap'.  So the SQL would be:  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards JOIN sets ON cards.setCode = sets.code AND sets.name = 'Coldsnap' WHERE convertedManaCost > 5 AND (power IS NULL OR power = '*');  But wait, in the original tables provided, I don't see any data for the Coldsnap set. The example inserts only have data for the legalities and set_translations. So when testing this query, it might return zero if there's no such set in the sets table.  Hmm, but according to the problem statement, 'Coldsnap' is a known set with name = 'Coldsnap', so I assume that exists in the database. Therefore, the above query should correctly count the number of cards meeting all criteria. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE (power IS NULL OR power = '*') AND convertedManaCost > 5 AND name = 'Coldsnap'
SELECT      fd.flavorText AS italian_flavor_text FROM      cards c LEFT JOIN      foreign_data fd ON c.uuid = fd.uuid AND fd.language = 'Italian' WHERE      c.name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'; 
SELECT language FROM foreign_data  WHERE uuid = (SELECT uuid FROM cards WHERE name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen')  AND flavorText IS NOT NULL; 
SELECT fd.text AS german_type FROM foreign_data fd JOIN cards c ON fd.uuid = c.uuid WHERE c.name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen' AND fd.language = 'German'; 
SELECT r.* FROM cards c JOIN sets s ON c.setCode = s.code JOIN rulings r ON c.uuid = r.uuid WHERE s.name = 'Coldsnap'; 
SELECT c.name AS "Card Name", fd.translation AS "Italian Name" FROM cards c JOIN foreign_data fd ON c.uuid = fd.uuid AND fd.language = 'Italian' WHERE c.setCode = (SELECT code FROM sets WHERE name = 'Coldsnap') AND c.convertedManaCost = (     SELECT MAX(c2.convertedManaCost)     FROM cards c2     WHERE c2.setCode = (SELECT code FROM sets WHERE name = 'Coldsnap') ); 
SELECT r.date  FROM rulings r  INNER JOIN cards c  ON r.uuid = c.uuid  WHERE c.name = 'Reminisce'; 
SELECT      (COUNT(CASE WHEN c.convertedManaCost = 7 THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(c.id)) * 100 AS percentage FROM cards c JOIN sets s ON c.setCode = s.code WHERE s.name = 'Coldsnap'; 
SELECT      CAST(         SUM(CASE              WHEN name = 'Coldsnap' AND cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL THEN 1              ELSE 0          END) /          SUM(CASE WHEN name = 'Coldsnap' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100      ) AS PERCENTAGE FROM cards; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the user's question: "What's the code for the set which was released on 2017/7/14?" Let me break this down step by step.  First, I should identify which table contains information about sets and their release dates. From the provided schema, there's a `sets` table with a column named `releaseDate`. That seems like the right place to look.  Next, I need to find the specific set where the `releaseDate` matches '2017-07-14'. So I'll use a SELECT statement targeting the `code` column from the `sets` table. The WHERE clause will filter records based on the release date.  I should make sure the date format in the query matches the expected format in the database, which is 'YYYY-MM-DD'. Since the user mentioned that "released on 2017/7/14" refers to '2017-07-14', I'll use that exact string in the WHERE condition.  Putting it all together, my SQL query will select the `code` from the `sets` table where the `releaseDate` is exactly '2017-07-14'. That should give me the desired set code. </think>  SELECT code FROM sets WHERE releaseDate = '2017-07-14';
SELECT keyruneCode FROM sets WHERE code = 'PKHC'; 
SELECT mcmId FROM sets WHERE code = 'SS2'; 
SELECT mcmName FROM sets WHERE releaseDate = '2017-06-09'; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the user's question: "For the set 'From the Vault: Lore', what is its expansion type?"   First, let me parse the question. The user wants to know the expansion type of a specific set named "From the Vault: Lore". Expansion type refers to the 'type' field in the database schema provided.  Looking at the database schema, there's a table called `sets` which contains information about different sets. This table has several columns including `name`, `code`, and `type`. The user is asking for the 'type' of the set where the name matches "From the Vault: Lore".   So, I need to query the `sets` table and filter the rows where the `name` column equals "From the Vault: Lore", then return the value in the `type` column for that row.  I should make sure that the SQL statement correctly selects the 'type' from the 'sets' table with the appropriate condition. The basic structure would be:  SELECT type FROM sets WHERE name = 'From the Vault: Lore';  This seems straightforward, but I want to double-check if there might be any case sensitivity issues or if the set name is unique. Since SQL queries are generally case-insensitive for string comparisons (unless specified otherwise), and assuming each set's name is unique in the database, this query should accurately retrieve the expansion type.  I also need to consider if the name could have slight variations, but given the exact question, it's safe to use the provided name directly.   So, the final SQL statement would simply select the 'type' from 'sets' where the name matches exactly. </think>  SELECT type FROM sets WHERE name = 'From the Vault: Lore';
SELECT parentCode FROM sets WHERE name = 'Commander 2014 Oversized'; 
<think> Alright, I need to tackle this SQL query problem. Let's break down what the user is asking for.  First, they want all cards illustrated by Jim Pavelec. So, looking at the `cards` table, the artist field should be 'Jim Pavelec'. That gives me the condition `artist = 'Jim Pavelec'`.  Next, they want to describe the text of the rulings for these cards. The rulings are stored in the `rulings` table, which has a foreign key `uuid` referencing the `cards` table. So, I'll need to join the `cards` and `rulings` tables on the `uuid` field.  Then, they're asking if these cards have missing or degraded properties and values. From the extra knowledge, this is determined by whether `hasContentWarning` equals 1 in the `cards` table. So, I'll include that column in the results to check its value.  I need to select specific columns: the card's name, the ruling text, and the content warning status. The `name` from `cards`, `text` from `rulings`, and `hasContentWarning` from `cards`.  Putting it all together, I'll use a SELECT statement with INNER JOIN between `cards` and `rulings` on their `uuid`. The WHERE clause will filter for the artist.  I should also make sure to only include each card once per ruling, so using DISTINCT might be necessary if there are multiple rulings per card. Wait, no, the user didn't specify, but since they want all rulings, maybe it's better without DISTINCT to capture every ruling entry.  Wait, actually, in the `rulings` table, each row is a separate ruling for a card, so joining without DISTINCT will include all of them. But if the user wants each card with its rulings, perhaps including multiple rows per card is acceptable.  So finalizing the query: select name, text, hasContentWarning from cards inner join rulings on uuid where artist is 'Jim Pavelec'. </think>  SELECT c.name, r.text, c.hasContentWarning  FROM cards c INNER JOIN rulings r ON c.uuid = r.uuid WHERE c.artist = 'Jim Pavelec'
<think> Alright, I need to figure out the SQL query that answers the user's question: "What was the release date for the set which contains the card 'Evacuation'?"   First, I'll break down the problem. The user wants the release date of a specific set. The set is identified by containing the card named 'Evacuation'. So, I need to connect the cards table with the sets table.  I know that each card belongs to a set through the 'setCode' in the cards table and the 'code' in the sets table. So, I'll join these two tables on this common field.   The steps are: 1. Select the releaseDate from the sets table. 2. Join the sets table with the cards table where sets.code = cards.setCode. 3. Filter the results to only include the card where name = 'Evacuation'.  I should use an INNER JOIN because I'm combining rows from both tables based on a related column. The ON clause will specify that sets.code equals cards.setCode. Then, the WHERE clause will filter for the card named 'Evacuation'.   Putting it all together, the SQL query will join the two tables and fetch the release date where the card's name is 'Evacuation'. </think>  SELECT s.releaseDate FROM sets s INNER JOIN cards c ON s.code = c.setCode WHERE c.name = 'Evacuation'
SELECT s.baseSetSize  FROM sets s  INNER JOIN set_translations st  ON s.code = st.setCode  WHERE st.translation = 'Rinascita di Alara' AND st.language = 'Italian'; 
SELECT s.type  FROM sets s  INNER JOIN set_translations st ON s.code = st.setCode  WHERE st.translation = 'Huitième édition'; 
SELECT st.name AS french_set_name FROM foreign_data fd JOIN cards c ON fd.card_uuid = c.uuid JOIN set_translations st ON c.setcode = st.setCode AND st.language = 'French' WHERE fd.translation = 'Tendo Ice Bridge' AND fd.language = 'French'; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM set_translations WHERE setCode = (SELECT code FROM sets WHERE name = 'Tenth Edition'); 
SELECT st.translation  FROM set_translations st WHERE st.setCode = (SELECT c.setCode FROM cards c WHERE c.name = 'Fellwar Stone') AND st.language = 'Japanese'; 
SELECT c.name, c.convertedManaCost  FROM cards c INNER JOIN sets s ON c.setCode = s.code  WHERE s.name = 'Journey into Nyx Hero''s Path' ORDER BY c.convertedManaCost DESC  LIMIT 1; 
SELECT s.releaseDate  FROM sets s  INNER JOIN set_translations st  ON s.code = st.setCode  WHERE st.translation = 'Ola de frío'; 
SELECT s.type  FROM sets s JOIN cards c ON s.id = c.set_id WHERE c.name = 'Samite Pilgrim'; 
SELECT COUNT(c.id) FROM sets s JOIN cards c ON s.code = c.setCode WHERE s.name = 'World Championship Decks 2004' AND c.convertedManaCost = 3; 
SELECT st.translation FROM sets s INNER JOIN set_translations st ON s.code = st.setcode WHERE s.name = 'Mirrodin' AND st.language = 'Chinese Simplified'; 
SELECT      (COUNT(CASE WHEN s.isNonFoilOnly = 1 THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(s.code)) * 100 AS japanese_non_foil_percentage FROM sets s WHERE EXISTS (     SELECT 1 FROM set_translations st WHERE st.setCode = s.code AND st.language = 'Japanese' ); 
SELECT      (SUM(s.isOnlineOnly) * 100.0) / COUNT(s.setCode) FROM      sets s WHERE      s.code IN (         SELECT DISTINCT st.setCode         FROM set_translations st         WHERE st.language = 'Portuguese (Brazil)'     ); 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is: "What are the available printing types of the cards that doesn't have a text box created by Aleksi Briclot?" Let me break this down step by step.  First, I'll look at the database schema provided. There's a 'cards' table which has various columns. The relevant columns here are 'artist', 'isTextless', and 'availability'.   The user mentioned that "created by Aleksi Briclot" refers to the artist column being 'Aleksi Briclot'. So, I need to filter the rows where artist equals that name.  Next, "doesn't have a text box" translates to the 'isTextless' column being 1. So, I should include a condition where isTextless = 1.  Then, "available printing types" refers to the 'availability' column. I need to retrieve the distinct values from this column for the filtered rows. Using DISTINCT will ensure I get each unique availability type only once.  Putting it all together, I'll select the distinct 'availability' from the 'cards' table where artist is 'Aleksi Briclot' and isTextless is 1.   I should make sure to write the SQL without any comments, as per the user's instruction. </think>  SELECT DISTINCT availability FROM cards WHERE artist = 'Aleksi Briclot' AND isTextless = 1;
SELECT id FROM sets WHERE baseSetSize = (SELECT MAX(baseSetSize) FROM sets)

SELECT l.format, c.name AS card_name FROM legalities l JOIN cards c ON l.uuid = c.uuid WHERE l.status = 'Banned' AND l.format IN (   SELECT format   FROM (     SELECT l.format, COUNT(*) as cnt     FROM legalities l     WHERE l.status = 'Banned'     GROUP BY l.format   ) sub_banned   WHERE cnt = (SELECT MAX(cnt) FROM (     SELECT l.format, COUNT(*) as cnt     FROM legalities l     WHERE l.status = 'Banned'     GROUP BY l.format   ) max_sub) );

<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let's break down what they're asking.  First, the user is looking for cards where frameVersion is '1997'. So in the cards table, I should filter by that condition. That means adding a WHERE clause like `frameVersion = '1997'`.  Next, these cards are illustrated by D. Alexander Gregory. The artist's name is stored in the artist column of the cards table, so I need to include that in my conditions: `artist = 'D. Alexander Gregory'`.  The question also mentions "sensitive content or Wizards of the Coast". Wait, sensitive content refers to hasContentWarning = 1. So, I think it's an OR condition here. Either the card has sensitive content (hasContentWarning = 1) or the artist is Wizards of the Coast. Hmm, but in this case, the artist is specifically D. Alexander Gregory, so maybe "or Wizards of the Coast" refers to another column? Wait, no, perhaps it's a mistake because the artist is already specified as D. Alexander Gregory. Maybe the user meant that either hasContentWarning is 1 or the content relates to Wizards of the Coast, but I'm not sure how that ties into the columns. Alternatively, maybe "sensitive content" is just hasContentWarning = 1.  Wait, the user's note clarifies: sensitive content refers to hasContentWarning = 1, so I should include `hasContentWarning = 1`.  Now, they want the status of the card in legacy play format. Status comes from the legalities table where the format is 'legacy' and the status corresponds to that.  So, I need to join the cards table with legalities on uuid because each card's UUID links to its legal entries. So, something like `JOIN legalities ON cards.uuid = legalities.uuid`.  Then, filter for where the legal format is 'legacy': `legalities.format = 'legacy'`.  Putting it all together: I need to select the status from legalities where frameVersion is 1997, artist is D. Alexander Gregory, hasContentWarning is 1, and format is legacy.  Wait, but the user also mentioned "or Wizards of the Coast". Hmm, perhaps they meant either hasContentWarning = 1 or the contentWarning relates to Wizards? But I'm not sure how that's stored. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and they just want hasContentWarning = 1. Since the note specified sensitive content as hasContentWarning=1, I'll go with that.  So, the SQL should join cards and legalities on uuid, then apply all these conditions in WHERE clause: frameVersion, artist, format, and hasContentWarning.  I think that's it. So the query selects status from both tables where all those conditions are met. </think>  SELECT l.status FROM cards c JOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid WHERE c.frameVersion = '1997' AND c.artist = 'D. Alexander Gregory' AND l.format = 'legacy' AND c.hasContentWarning = 1

SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM users WHERE UpVotes > 100 AND DownVotes > 1; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how many users have more than 10 views and created their account after the year 2013. Let's break this down step by step.  First, I'm looking at the database schema provided. The relevant table here is the `users` table because it contains information about each user, including their Views and CreationDate.  The question has two main conditions: 1. Users with more than 10 views: So, in SQL terms, this would be where the Views column is greater than 10. 2. Created after the year 2013: This refers to the CreationDate being in a year after 2013. Since we're dealing with dates, I'll need to extract the year from the CreationDate.  I should use the `WHERE` clause to apply these filters. The `Views > 10` part is straightforward. For the date, I can use the `strftime` function in SQLite to get the year from CreationDate and then check if it's greater than 2013.  Putting this together, I'll select the count of users who meet both conditions. So the query will start with `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users`. Then, add the WHERE clause for both conditions: Views >10 and the year part of CreationDate >2013.  I need to make sure that the date formatting is correct. In SQLite, `strftime('%Y', CreationDate)` extracts the year as a string, which I can then compare numerically by converting it with `CAST(... AS INT)` or just comparing as strings since years are numeric.  Wait, actually, in SQLite, comparing the extracted year as a string should work because '2014' is greater than '2013'. But to be safe, maybe cast it to an integer. So, something like `CAST(strftime('%Y', CreationDate) AS INT) > 2013`.  Putting it all together, the query becomes selecting the count from users where Views >10 and the year of CreationDate is greater than 2013.  I think that's it. Let me write that out. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE Views > 10 AND CAST(strftime('%Y', CreationDate) AS INT) > 2013
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts WHERE OwnerUserId = (SELECT Id FROM users WHERE DisplayName = 'csgillespie'); 
SELECT p.Title  FROM Posts p INNER JOIN Users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id WHERE u.DisplayName = 'csgillespie'; 
SELECT u.DisplayName  FROM posts p  INNER JOIN users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id  WHERE p.Title = 'Eliciting priors from experts'; 
SELECT p.Title  FROM users u JOIN posts p ON u.Id = p.OwnerUserId WHERE u.DisplayName = 'csgillespie' ORDER BY p.ViewCount DESC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT u.DisplayName FROM posts p JOIN users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id WHERE p.FavoriteCount = (SELECT MAX(FavoriteCount) FROM posts); 
SELECT SUM(p.CommentCount) AS TotalComments FROM posts p WHERE p.OwnerUserId = (SELECT Id FROM users WHERE DisplayName = 'csgillespie'); 
SELECT MAX(AnswerCount) AS MaxAnswers FROM posts WHERE OwnerDisplayName = 'csgillespie'; 
SELECT u.DisplayName  FROM posts p  INNER JOIN users u ON p.LastEditorUserId = u.Id  WHERE p.Title = 'Examples for teaching: Correlation does not mean causation'; 
SELECT COUNT(*) AS RootPostCount FROM posts INNER JOIN users ON posts.OwnerUserId = users.Id WHERE users.DisplayName = 'csgillespie' AND posts.ParentId IS NULL; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The user asked for the display names of all users who own a post that is well-finished. From the extra knowledge provided, a well-finished post is one where ClosedDate is not null.  First, let me look at the database schema. The relevant table here seems to be the 'posts' table because it contains information about posts and their ownership. In the 'posts' table, there's an 'OwnerDisplayName' field which probably holds the display name of the user who owns the post. Also, each post has an 'Id', and the 'ClosedDate' field indicates if a post is closed.  So, I need to select the 'OwnerDisplayName' from the 'posts' table where 'ClosedDate' is not null. That makes sense because only posts with a ClosedDate are considered well-finished.  Wait, but what if the OwnerDisplayName could be null? The user's question asks for display names, so maybe we should handle cases where it might be null to avoid issues. However, since the question doesn't specify that, I'll assume that every post has an owner with a valid DisplayName.  Putting it together, the SQL query would select 'OwnerDisplayName' from 'posts' where 'ClosedDate' is not null. That should give me all users who own such posts. </think>  SELECT OwnerDisplayName FROM posts WHERE ClosedDate IS NOT NULL
SELECT COUNT(p.Id) FROM posts p INNER JOIN users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id WHERE u.Age > 65 AND p.Score >= 20; 
<think> Alright, so I need to figure out the SQL query that answers the question: "What is the location of the owner of the post 'Eliciting priors from experts'?" Let me break this down step by step.  First, I know that the database has several tables, but the key ones here are `posts` and `users`. The `posts` table contains information about each post, including the title and the OwnerUserId. The `users` table holds user details like DisplayName, Location, etc.  The question is asking for the location of the owner. So, I need to find the owner's user ID from the posts table where the Title matches 'Eliciting priors from experts'. Once I have that User ID, I can then look up their location in the users table.  I should start by selecting the OwnerUserId from the `posts` table where the Title is exactly 'Eliciting priors from experts'. That would be something like:  SELECT OwnerUserId FROM posts WHERE Title = 'Eliciting priors from experts';  But wait, I remember that sometimes titles might have variations or extra spaces. To ensure I get the correct post even if there are slight differences, maybe using LIKE with wildcards would help. So perhaps:  SELECT OwnerUserId FROM posts WHERE Title LIKE '%Eliciting priors from experts%';  However, since the title is specific and probably unique, using an exact match might be better for performance and accuracy.  Once I get the OwnerUserId, I need to join this information with the `users` table to find the corresponding Location. So, I can use an INNER JOIN on the users table where Id matches the OwnerUserId from posts.  Putting it all together, the SQL query should select the Location field from the users table where there's a matching post title in the posts table. This would involve joining the two tables based on the OwnerUserId and filtering by the specific Title.  I think using an INNER JOIN is appropriate here because we're looking for records that exist in both tables. So, the final query should join `posts` and `users` on OwnerUserId = Id and have a WHERE clause to filter the Title.  Let me write this out:  SELECT u.Location FROM posts p INNER JOIN users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id WHERE p.Title = 'Eliciting priors from experts';  Wait, but in SQL, aliasing tables is common practice for clarity. Using p for posts and u for users makes the query more readable.  I should also make sure that the case of the Title matches exactly unless the database is set to be case-insensitive. Since I'm not sure about the database settings, it's safer to assume exact match unless specified otherwise.  Another consideration: if there are multiple posts with the same title, this might return multiple locations. But in the context of this question, I think we're looking for a single post, so perhaps adding DISTINCT or limiting the results would be helpful. However, since the user is asking specifically about "the owner," implying one person, maybe it's safe to proceed without.  Also, checking if the OwnerUserId might be NULL. If the post doesn't have an owner, this could cause issues, but given the context, I think we can assume there's a valid OwnerUserId for that post.  I should test this query with sample data to ensure it works as expected. For example, if the posts table has a row where Title is 'Eliciting priors from experts' and OwnerUserId is 123, and the users table has a user with Id=123 and Location='New York', then the query should return 'New York'.  I think that covers all bases. Now, putting it all together without any comments as per the instructions. </think>  SELECT u.Location FROM posts p INNER JOIN users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id WHERE p.Title = 'Eliciting priors from experts'
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "From which post is the tag 'bayesian' excerpted from? Please give the body of the post."  First, let me understand the database schema provided. The relevant tables here are `tags` and `posts`.   The `tags` table has columns like Id, TagName, Count, ExcerptPostId, and WikiPostId. From the extra knowledge given, I know that "bayesian" is the TagName, and the excerpt refers to ExcerptPostId. So, the ExcerptPostId in the tags table corresponds to the post from which the tag's excerpt is taken.  My goal is to find the post where the tag 'bayesian' gets its excerpt. That means I need to join the `tags` table with the `posts` table using the ExcerptPostId as the key.  Here's how I'll approach it step by step:  1. **Select the required columns**: The question asks for the body of the post, so I'll select `Body` from the `posts` table. But to ensure clarity, I might also include the post's Title or Id for better understanding.  2. **Join the tables**: I need to join the `tags` and `posts` tables where `tags.ExcerptPostId = posts.Id`. This way, I can link each tag to its corresponding excerpt post.  3. **Filter by TagName**: Since I'm specifically looking for the 'bayesian' tag, I'll add a WHERE clause to filter rows where `TagName = 'bayesian'`.  4. **Execute the query**: Once the SQL is written, executing it will give me the body of the post from which the 'bayesian' tag's excerpt is taken.  Wait, let me double-check if there are any other considerations. For example, does the ExcerptPostId correspond to posts that might have multiple tags? But no, each row in `tags` represents a specific tag, so joining on ExcerptPostId should give the correct post for that particular tag's excerpt.  Also, I need to make sure that both tables are joined correctly. The `ExcerptPostId` is a foreign key referencing the `Id` in `posts`, so an INNER JOIN would be appropriate here because we only want rows where there's a match between both tables.  So putting it all together, my SQL query will select the post's body from `posts` where the tag 'bayesian' has its ExcerptPostId matching the post's Id. </think>  SELECT p.Body FROM tags t INNER JOIN posts p ON t.ExcerptPostId = p.Id WHERE t.TagName = 'bayesian';
SELECT p.Body  FROM tags t  JOIN posts p ON t.ExcerptPostId = p.Id  WHERE t.Count = (SELECT MAX(Count) FROM tags)  LIMIT 1; 
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM badges  INNER JOIN users ON badges.UserId = users.Id  WHERE users.DisplayName = 'csgillespie'; 
SELECT b.Name  FROM users u  INNER JOIN badges b ON u.Id = b.UserId  WHERE u.DisplayName = 'csgillespie'; 
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM badges  INNER JOIN users ON badges.UserId = users.Id  WHERE users.DisplayName = 'csgillespie' AND YEAR(badges.Date) = 2011; 
SELECT u.DisplayName FROM (   SELECT UserId, COUNT(Id) AS BadgeCount   FROM badges   GROUP BY UserId ) b JOIN users u ON b.UserId = u.Id WHERE b.BadgeCount = (SELECT MAX(BadgeCount) FROM (SELECT UserId, COUNT(Id) AS BadgeCount FROM badges GROUP BY UserId) AS sub); 
SELECT AVG(Score) AS average_score FROM posts WHERE OwnerUserId = (SELECT Id FROM users WHERE DisplayName = 'csgillespie'); 
SELECT      SUM(COALESCE(bc.cnt, 0)) / COUNT(u.Id) AS average_badges FROM users u LEFT JOIN (     SELECT UserId, COUNT(Id) as cnt     FROM badges     GROUP BY UserId ) bc ON u.Id = bc.UserId WHERE u.Views > 200; 
SELECT      (COUNT(CASE WHEN u.Age > 65 THEN p.Id END) / COUNT(p.Id)) * 100 AS percentage_elder_owned FROM      posts p JOIN      users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id WHERE      p.Score > 5; 
SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM votes WHERE UserId = 58 AND CreationDate = '2010-07-19'; 
SELECT CreationDate FROM votes GROUP BY CreationDate ORDER BY COUNT(Id) DESC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM badges WHERE Name = 'Revival'; 
SELECT Title FROM Posts WHERE Id = (SELECT PostId FROM Comments WHERE Score = (SELECT MAX(Score) FROM Comments)); 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE PostId = (SELECT Id FROM posts WHERE ViewCount = 1910); 
SELECT FavoriteCount  FROM posts  WHERE Id = (     SELECT PostId      FROM comments      WHERE UserId = 3025 AND CreationDate = '2014/04/23 20:29:39.0' ); 
SELECT c.Text FROM posts p JOIN comments c ON p.Id = c.PostId WHERE p.ParentId = 107829 AND p.CommentCount = '1'; 
SELECT c.*, p.ClosedDate  FROM comments c  INNER JOIN posts p ON c.PostId = p.Id  WHERE UserId = 23853 AND CreationDate = '2013-07-12 09:08:18.0'; 
<think> Alright, let me try to figure out how to solve this SQL problem. The user is asking for the reputation points of the owner user of post number 65041.   First, I need to understand the database schema provided. There's a `posts` table and a `users` table. The `posts` table has an `OwnerUserId` field which links to the `Id` in the `users` table. That means I can join these two tables on those fields.  So, the goal is to get the Reputation from the users where their Id matches the OwnerUserId of post 65041. Since the user provided that post number refers to Id = '65041', I should use that specific Id in the WHERE clause of the posts table.  I'll start by selecting the Reputation column from the `users` table. Then, I'll join it with the `posts` table on `OwnerUserId` equals `users.Id`. Finally, I need to filter for post Id 65041.  Wait, let me make sure about the join. The `posts` table has OwnerUserId, which is a foreign key to users(Id). So an INNER JOIN makes sense here because we're looking for records where both tables have matching data.  Putting it all together, the query should select Reputation from Users after joining with Posts on OwnerUserId and filtering Posts where Id is 65041. </think>  SELECT u.Reputation FROM users u INNER JOIN posts p ON u.Id = p.OwnerUserId WHERE p.Id = '65041'
SELECT COUNT(p.Id)  FROM posts p JOIN users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id WHERE u.DisplayName = 'Tiago Pasqualini'; 
SELECT u.DisplayName  FROM votes v  INNER JOIN users u ON v.UserId = u.Id  WHERE v.Id = '6347'; 
SELECT COUNT(v.Id)  FROM votes v INNER JOIN posts p ON v.PostId = p.Id WHERE p.Title LIKE '%data visualization%'; 
SELECT b.Name  FROM badges b  INNER JOIN users u  ON b.UserId = u.Id  WHERE u.DisplayName = 'DatEpicCoderGuyWhoPrograms'; 
SELECT      (SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM posts WHERE OwnerUserId = 24) /      (SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM votes WHERE UserId = 24) AS PostToVoteRatio; 
SELECT ViewCount FROM posts WHERE Title = 'Integration of Weka and/or RapidMiner into Informatica PowerCenter/Developer'; 
SELECT Text FROM comments WHERE Score = 17; 
SELECT DisplayName FROM users WHERE WebsiteUrl = 'http://stackoverflow.com'; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "What is the badge name that user 'SilentGhost' obtained?" Let me break this down step by step.  First, I know that the database schema includes a table called `badges` which has information about badges users have earned. The relevant columns here are `UserId` and `Name`. The `users` table contains user details, including `DisplayName`.  The question specifies that 'SilentGhost' is the DisplayName of the user. So I need to find the user with DisplayName 'SilentGhost' in the `users` table. Once I have that user's Id, I can look into the `badges` table to find the badge(s) they've obtained.  I should join the `users` and `badges` tables on the `UserId` field because that links a user to their badges. The type of JOIN needed here is an INNER JOIN since we only want users who have at least one badge.  So, the SQL query will select the `Name` from `badges` where the corresponding user's DisplayName is 'SilentGhost'. I'll structure it by selecting from both tables and using a WHERE clause to filter the DisplayName.  Putting it all together, I'll write a SELECT statement that joins `users` and `badges` on UserId and filters where DisplayName is 'SilentGhost'. </think>  To determine the badge name obtained by the user 'SilentGhost', we need to join the `users` and `badges` tables based on the `UserId`. The DisplayName in the `users` table should match 'SilentGhost' to identify the correct user, and then retrieve their badge from the `badges` table.  **Answer:** SELECT b.Name FROM users u INNER JOIN badges b ON u.Id = b.UserId WHERE u.DisplayName = 'SilentGhost';
SELECT UserDisplayName FROM comments WHERE Text = 'thank you user93!'; 
SELECT c.Text  FROM users u INNER JOIN comments c ON u.Id = c.UserId WHERE u.DisplayName = 'A Lion'; 
SELECT u.DisplayName, u.Reputation  FROM users u  INNER JOIN posts p  ON u.Id = p.OwnerUserId  WHERE p.Title = 'Understanding what Dassault iSight is doing?'; 
SELECT c.Text  FROM comments c WHERE c.PostId = (SELECT p.Id FROM posts p WHERE p.Title = 'How does gentle boosting differ from AdaBoost?') 
SELECT DISTINCT u.DisplayName  FROM badges b JOIN users u ON b.UserId = u.Id WHERE b.Name = 'Necromancer' LIMIT 10; 
SELECT COALESCE(u.DisplayName, 'No Editor') AS Editor FROM posts p LEFT JOIN users u ON p.LastEditorUserId = u.Id WHERE p.Title = 'Open source tools for visualizing multi-dimensional data'; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that lists the titles of posts edited by Vebjørn Ljosa. Let me start by understanding what's given and what needs to be done.  First, I look at the database schema provided. The relevant tables here are 'users' and 'posts'. The 'posts' table has a column called LastEditorDisplayName which likely holds the name of the last person who edited the post. Since Vebjørn Ljosa's DisplayName is what we're looking for, that seems like the key column to use.  Wait, but sometimes systems might store the user ID and display name separately. So I need to check if the 'posts' table has a LastEditorDisplayName column or if it only has LastEditorUserId which would require joining with the 'users' table.  Looking back at the schema, yes, the 'posts' table does have both LastEditorUserId and LastEditorDisplayName. That means I can directly query using the DisplayName without needing to join tables, which simplifies things.  So my task is to select the Title from posts where LastEditorDisplayName equals 'Vebjørn Ljosa'.   I should make sure that the name is exactly as it's stored in the database, including any case sensitivity. Since SQL can be case-sensitive depending on the collation settings, I'll assume exact match.  Putting it all together, my query will select the Title from posts where LastEditorDisplayName is 'Vebjørn Ljosa'. That should give me the desired list of post titles edited by him. </think>  SELECT Title FROM posts WHERE LastEditorDisplayName = 'Vebjorn Ljosa';
SELECT u.WebsiteUrl, SUM(p.Score) AS TotalScore FROM posts p INNER JOIN users u ON p.LastEditorUserId = u.Id WHERE u.DisplayName = 'Yevgeny' GROUP BY u.WebsiteUrl; 
SELECT Id FROM Posts WHERE Title = 'Why square...' 
SELECT SUM(v.BountyAmount) AS TotalBounty FROM votes v INNER JOIN posts p ON v.PostId = p.Id WHERE p.Title LIKE '%data%'; 
SELECT u.DisplayName  FROM votes v  INNER JOIN posts p ON v.PostId = p.Id  INNER JOIN users u ON v.UserId = u.Id  WHERE v.BountyAmount = 50 AND p.Title LIKE '%variance%'; 
SELECT p.*, t.TagName  FROM Posts p JOIN PostTags pt ON p.PostId = pt.PostId JOIN Tags t ON pt.TagId = t.TagId WHERE t.TagName = 'humor'; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE UserId = 13; 
SELECT Id FROM Users ORDER BY Reputation DESC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT Id FROM users WHERE Views = (SELECT MIN(Views) FROM users); 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT UserId) FROM badges WHERE Name = 'Supporter' AND strftime('%Y', Date) = '2011'; 
SELECT COUNT(UserId) FROM (   SELECT UserId, COUNT(Name) AS BadgeCount    FROM badges    WHERE UserId IS NOT NULL    GROUP BY UserId    HAVING COUNT(Name) > 5 ) 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT u.Id)  FROM users u WHERE u.Location = 'New York' AND u.Id IN (   SELECT b1.UserId FROM badges b1 WHERE b1.Name = 'Teacher'    INTERSECT    SELECT b2.UserId FROM badges b2 WHERE b2.Name = 'Supporter' ); 
SELECT p.OwnerUserId AS UserId, u.Reputation  FROM posts p  INNER JOIN users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id  WHERE p.Id = 1; 
SELECT u.Id, u.DisplayName FROM Users u JOIN (     SELECT p.UserId, COUNT(p.Id) as PostCount, SUM(p.Views) as TotalViews     FROM Posts p     GROUP BY p.UserId ) sub ON u.UserId = sub.UserId WHERE sub.PostCount = 1 AND sub.TotalViews >= 1000; 
WITH CommentCounts AS (     SELECT UserId, COUNT(Id) as CommentCount     FROM comments     GROUP BY UserId ) SELECT u.DisplayName, cc.CommentCount, b.Name as BadgeName, b.Date as BadgeDate FROM users u LEFT JOIN CommentCounts cc ON u.Id = cc.UserId LEFT JOIN badges b ON u.Id = b.UserId ORDER BY cc.CommentCount DESC; 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT u.Id)  FROM users u  INNER JOIN badges b ON u.Id = b.UserId  WHERE u.Location = 'India' AND b.Name = 'Teacher'; 
SELECT      ((SELECT COUNT(Date) FROM badges WHERE YEAR(Date)=2010 AND Name='Student') / (SELECT COUNT(Name) FROM badges WHERE Name='Student')) * 100 -      ((SELECT COUNT(Date) FROM badges WHERE YEAR(Date)=2011 AND Name='Student') / (SELECT COUNT(Name) FROM badges WHERE Name='Student')) * 100

SELECT p.Score, pl.LinkTypeId  FROM posts p  INNER JOIN postLinks pl ON p.Id = pl.PostId  WHERE p.Id = 395; 
SELECT Id, OwnerUserId FROM posts WHERE Score > 60; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "What is the sum of favourite count gained by user ID 686 in 2011?"   First, let's break down the question. The key points are: - Sum of FavouriteCount - For User ID 686 - In the year 2011  I remember from the database schema provided that the 'posts' table has both OwnerUserId and CreationDate. So, I should focus on that table.  The FavouriteCount is a column in the 'posts' table, so I'll need to sum that. The OwnerUserId should be 686 because we're interested in that specific user's posts.   As for the year being 2011, I need to filter the CreationDate to only include dates within that year. In SQL, the date can be compared by extracting the year part. So, using the STRFTIME function with '%Y' will get the year as a string and compare it to '2011'.  Putting this together, I'll select from the posts where OwnerUserId is 686 and the creation year is 2011, then sum the FavoriteCount.  I should also make sure that if there are no such posts, the SUM function will return NULL, but that's acceptable since the question asks for the sum.  So, the SQL query would select the sum of FavoriteCount from posts where OwnerUserId = 686 and STRFTIME('%Y', CreationDate) = '2011'. </think>  SELECT SUM(FavoriteCount) FROM posts WHERE OwnerUserId = 686 AND STRFTIME('%Y', CreationDate) = '2011'
WITH UserPostCount AS (     SELECT OwnerUserId, COUNT(*) as PostCount     FROM posts     WHERE OwnerUserId IS NOT NULL     GROUP BY OwnerUserId ) SELECT      (Sum(u.UpVotes) / COUNT(u.Id)) as AvgUpVotes,     (Sum(u.Age) / COUNT(u.Id)) as AvgAge FROM users u JOIN UserPostCount c ON u.Id = c.OwnerUserId WHERE c.PostCount > 10; 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT UserId) AS NumberOfUsers FROM badges WHERE Name = 'Announcer'; 
<think> Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking for the names of badges that users obtained on a specific date and time: July 19, 2010 at 7:39:08 PM. They've also provided the database schema and some sample data.  First, I need to identify which table holds the badge information along with the dates they were awarded. Looking at the schemas, the `badges` table seems relevant because it has a `Date` column that records when each badge was awarded. Each row in this table represents a badge earned by a user.  The key here is to extract the names of badges where the `Date` matches exactly the specified timestamp: '2010-07-19 19:39:08.0'. I notice that in the sample data provided for the `badges` table, each entry has a date of '2010-07-19 19:39:07.0', which is just one second before the target date. However, this might be a typo or perhaps the user intended to consider dates on that day regardless of the exact time.  But since the question specifically asks for badges obtained at exactly '2010-07-19 19:39:08.0', I should stick strictly to that. So, the SQL query needs to select the `Name` from the `badges` table where the `Date` column matches this precise value.  I also need to consider case sensitivity and formatting. In SQL, string comparisons are generally case-sensitive, but in this case, since dates are formatted as strings, it's crucial that the format matches exactly what's stored in the database. The user provided the date in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.S' format, so I should use that exact format in the WHERE clause.  Putting this together, the SQL query would involve selecting the `Name` column from `badges` where the `Date` is exactly '2010-07-19 19:39:08.0'.   I also need to ensure that only unique badge names are listed if there are multiple entries for the same badge on that date, but since each row represents a user obtaining the badge, it's possible that the same badge name appears multiple times. However, unless specified otherwise, the question just asks for the names, so duplicates might be acceptable.  Wait, in the sample data provided, all badges have dates of '2010-07-19 19:39:07.0', which is one second before the target date. So, if I run a query looking for exactly '2010-07-19 19:39:08.0', it might return no results because none of the entries match that exact time.  This makes me think—perhaps there's a typo in the user's question or in the sample data. Maybe they meant to use '2010-07-19 19:39:07.0' instead? But since I must follow the instructions precisely, I'll proceed with the given date and time.  Alternatively, maybe the user wants all badges awarded on that day, regardless of the exact time. In that case, I could adjust the query to filter by the date part only, using a function like `DATE()` or truncating the timestamp. But since the instruction is explicit about the exact datetime, I should adhere to it unless told otherwise.  So, considering all this, the SQL query would be straightforward: select the Name from badges where Date equals the specified value. It's possible that no rows will be returned because of the exact match, but without more data, I can't confirm that. </think>  SELECT Name FROM badges WHERE Date = '2010-07-19 19:39:08.0'
<think> Alright, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that counts the number of positive comments based on their scores. The user mentioned that a positive comment is defined as having a score greater than 60.   First, I should look at the database schema provided to identify where the comment data is stored. From the schema, there's a table named `comments` which includes a column `Score`. That makes sense since each comment would have an associated score.  Next, I need to count how many rows in this table have a `Score` greater than 60. So, the SQL query will involve selecting from the `comments` table where the `Score` meets that condition and then counting those entries.  I should structure the query using SELECT COUNT(*) as the way to get the total number. Then, specify FROM `comments`. Following that, add a WHERE clause to filter only the rows where `Score` > 60.   Putting it all together, the SQL statement would be straightforward: select count of all records in comments where score exceeds 60. I don't think there's any need for GROUP BY or HAVING because we're just counting the total number, not aggregating by any specific group.  I should also make sure that the syntax is correct and that the table name is correctly referenced as `comments`. Since some of the other tables have different names, but in this case, it's straightforward. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE Score > 60
SELECT Text FROM comments WHERE CreationDate = '2010-07-19 19:25:47.0'; 
SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM posts WHERE Score = 10; 
SELECT Name  FROM badges  WHERE UserId IN (   SELECT Id    FROM users    WHERE Reputation = (SELECT MAX(Reputation) FROM users) ); 
<think> Alright, let's break down what the user is asking for and how I can help them construct the correct SQL query.  First, the question is about finding the reputation of users who obtained a specific badge on a certain date. The badges table has the necessary information about when each badge was awarded. Each entry in badges includes a UserId, which links to the users table where the Reputation is stored.  So, I need to join these two tables. The key here is the UserId because it's common to both tables. By joining on UserId, I can link each badge award to the corresponding user's reputation.  Next, I have to filter for badges awarded on exactly '2010-07-19 19:39:08.0'. This means adding a WHERE clause that checks the Date column in badges against this specific timestamp.  Once I've selected all users who meet this condition, I just need to select their Reputation from the users table. Since each UserId might appear multiple times if they got multiple badges on that date, but we're only interested in unique users, I should use DISTINCT to avoid duplicates.  Putting it all together, the SQL query will join the badges and users tables on UserId, apply the date filter, and select distinct reputations. This ensures that each user's reputation is listed once, even if they earned multiple badges on that day. </think>  SELECT DISTINCT u.Reputation FROM users u INNER JOIN badges b ON u.Id = b.UserId WHERE b.Date = '2010-07-19 19:39:08.0'
SELECT b.Name  FROM badges b  JOIN users u ON b.UserId = u.Id  WHERE u.DisplayName = 'Pierre'; 
SELECT b.Date  FROM badges b  INNER JOIN users u ON b.UserId = u.Id  WHERE u.Location = 'Rochester, NY'; 
SELECT      (CAST(         (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT UserId) FROM badges WHERE Name = 'Teacher') AS REAL     ) /      (SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM users)     ) * 100; 
SELECT      (COUNT(CASE WHEN u.Age BETWEEN 13 AND 18 THEN b.UserId END) / COUNT(b.UserId)) * 100 AS TeenagerPercentage FROM badges b JOIN users u ON b.UserId = u.Id WHERE b.Name = 'Organizer'; 
SELECT c.Score  FROM comments c JOIN posts p ON c.PostId = p.Id WHERE p.CreaionDate = '2010-07-19 19:19:56.0'; 
<think> Alright, let's tackle this SQL problem step by step. The question is asking for the detailed content of a comment made on a specific post that was created on July 19, 2010, at 7:37:33 PM.   First, I need to identify which table holds the comments. From the database schema provided, there's a `comments` table with columns like Id, PostId, Score, Text, CreationDate, UserId, and UserDisplayName. So, this is where the comment data is stored.  The detailed content of the comment refers to the 'Text' column in the `comments` table. The user wants to retrieve the text of a specific comment based on its creation date.   Next, I need to find the exact CreationDate as given: 2010-07-19 19:37:33.0. This is the datetime format stored in the database, so I should use this value directly in my query.  So, the SQL query needs to select the 'Text' column from the `comments` table where the CreationDate matches exactly '2010-07-19 19:37:33.0'.   I don't see any joins needed here because the question is only about retrieving the comment's text based on its creation date, not linking it to other tables like users or posts unless necessary. But in this case, it doesn't seem necessary since we have the direct datetime.  Therefore, the SQL query will be a simple SELECT statement with a WHERE clause filtering by CreationDate. </think>  SELECT Text FROM comments WHERE CreationDate = '2010-07-19 19:37:33.0'
SELECT DISTINCT u.Age  FROM users u JOIN badges b ON u.Id = b.UserId WHERE u.Location = 'Vienna, Austria';

<think> Alright, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that lists all the names of users who obtained the Organizer Badges. Let's break this down step by step.  First, I know that user names are stored in the DisplayName field of the Users table. So, I'll definitely need to select that column. But the badges information is in a different table called Badges, so I have to connect these two tables somehow.  Looking at the schema, the Badges table has a UserId column which is a foreign key referencing the Id in the Users table. That means each badge is linked to a specific user. So, I should join the Users and Badges tables on the UserId field.  Next, I need to filter only those badges where the Name is 'Organizer'. Without this condition, I'd get all users with any badge, which isn't what I want. So, I'll add a WHERE clause to check that Badges.Name equals 'Organizer'.  Now, putting it together: I'll select DisplayName from Users and join with Badges on UserId. Then apply the filter for Organizer badges.  Wait, but do I need to handle any cases where multiple badges are given? Like if a user has more than one Organizer badge, would they appear multiple times? The question just says list all names, so duplicates might be okay unless specified otherwise. But since it's about listing users who obtained the badge, maybe each user should only appear once even if they have multiple badges. Hmm, but the example data doesn't show that scenario, and the question didn't specify distinct, so I'll proceed without DISTINCT for now.  So, the SQL would join Users and Badges on UserId, select DisplayName where Name is Organizer. </think>  SELECT DisplayName FROM Users INNER JOIN Badges ON Users.Id = Badges.UserId WHERE Name = 'Organizer'
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT pt.PostId) FROM posts p JOIN PostTags pt ON p.Id = pt.PostId JOIN tags t ON pt.TagId = t.Id WHERE p.OwnerDisplayName = 'Community'   AND t.Name = 'r'; 
SELECT      SUM(CASE WHEN u.DisplayName = 'Mornington' THEN p.ViewCount ELSE 0 END) -      SUM(CASE WHEN u.DisplayName = 'Amos' THEN p.ViewCount ELSE 0 END) FROM      posts p JOIN      users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id; 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT UserId) FROM badges WHERE Name = 'Commentator' AND strftime('%Y', Date) = '2014'; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts WHERE CreaionDate BETWEEN '2010-07-21 00:00:00' AND '2010-07-21 23:59:59'; 
SELECT u.DisplayName, u.Age  FROM users u WHERE u.Views = (SELECT MAX(Views) FROM users); 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The task is to find the last edit date and the last editor's user ID for a specific post titled "Detecting a given face in a database of facial images."  First, I should look at the database schema provided. From what I can see, there's a 'posts' table which contains all the necessary information about each post, including the title, last edit date, and last editor's user ID.  The key columns here are: - Title: to identify the correct post. - LastEditDate: the date when the post was last edited. - LastEditorUserId: the ID of the user who made the last edit.  So, my approach is to select 'LastEditDate' and 'LastEditorUserId' from the 'posts' table where the title matches the given string.   I need to make sure that I correctly reference the columns as they are named in the schema. The column names in the posts table are 'LastEditDate' and 'LastEditorUserId', so I'll use those exact names.  Putting it all together, the SQL query should select these two columns where the Title is exactly "Detecting a given face in a database of facial images."   I don't think any joins are necessary here since all required information is within the 'posts' table. Also, there's no need for additional conditions or subqueries because we're directly accessing the data based on the title.  So, the final SQL statement should look something like selecting those two columns from posts where Title equals that specific string. </think>  SELECT LastEditDate, LastEditorUserId FROM posts WHERE Title = 'Detecting a given face in a database of facial images'
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE UserId = 13 AND Score < 60; 
SELECT p.Title, c.UserDisplayName  FROM comments c  JOIN posts p ON c.PostId = p.Id  WHERE c.Score > 60; 
SELECT DISTINCT b.Name  FROM badges b  INNER JOIN users u ON b.UserId = u.Id  WHERE YEAR(b.Date) = 2011 AND u.Location = 'North Pole'; 
<think> Alright, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me break down what they're asking for.  The question is asking for the users' display names and their website URLs where the post has a favorite count of more than 150.   First, looking at the database schema provided, I see that the relevant tables here are likely `posts` and `users`. The `posts` table contains information about each post, including `FavoriteCount`, which is the field we need to filter on. It also has an `OwnerUserId` field, which links to the `users` table.  The `users` table has fields like `DisplayName` and `WebsiteUrl`, which are exactly what the user is asking for. So my plan is to join these two tables based on `OwnerUserId`.  I need to select `DisplayName` and `WebsiteUrl` from `users`, but I have to make sure that these correspond to posts where `FavoriteCount > 150`. Since the FavoriteCount is in the `posts` table, I'll use a JOIN between `posts` and `users` on `OwnerUserId`.  I should also consider if there are any other constraints. For example, ensuring that both tables have matching IDs for `OwnerUserId` to avoid nulls or mismatches. But since it's a foreign key relationship, I can safely assume that each `OwnerUserId` in `posts` exists in `users`.  Putting it all together, the SQL query should select the required fields from `users`, join with `posts` where `FavoriteCount > 150`, and ensure that only those rows are fetched. </think>  SELECT u.DisplayName, u.WebsiteUrl FROM users u INNER JOIN posts p ON u.Id = p.OwnerUserId WHERE p.FavoriteCount > 150
<think> Okay, let's see what the user is asking for here. They want me to describe the post history counts and the last edit date of a specific post titled "What is the best introductory Bayesian statistics textbook?". Hmm, so I need to figure out how to get that information from the given database schema.  First, I should identify which tables are relevant. The post history would be in the `postHistory` table, which includes details like the number of times a post has been edited and when those edits occurred. Also, each edit might have a comment or user associated with it, but for counts and dates, maybe I don't need that info.  The posts themselves are stored in the `posts` table, where the title is located. So I'll probably need to join these two tables somehow. The foreign key here would be `PostId`, which exists in both `posts` and `postHistory`.  I should filter the results to only include the post with the specific title mentioned. That means adding a WHERE clause on `Title` equals that string.  Now, for counting the number of edits, I need to count how many entries there are in `postHistory` for that particular post. So using COUNT(*) makes sense here.  As for the last edit date, I can take the maximum CreationDate from `postHistory`, since each entry's CreationDate represents when an edit was made. The most recent one would be the max date.  I should structure this as a SQL query. I'll start by selecting the count and the max date from `postHistory`. Then, I'll join it with `posts` on PostId to access the title. Finally, apply the WHERE clause to filter for the correct post title.  Wait, but in the schema provided, looking at the `postHistory` table, it has fields like CreationDate and UserId. So to get the last edit date, that's straightforward. The count is just how many times this post has an entry in `postHistory`.  I think I should use a LEFT JOIN to include all instances, but actually, since every post history entry corresponds to a post, maybe INNER JOIN is sufficient here.  Putting it all together: select the count of PostId and the max CreationDate from postHistory, join with posts on PostId where Title matches. That should give me both the number of edits and the last time it was edited.  Double-checking the schema to ensure I have the right field names. In `posts`, the title is under 'Title', so that's correct. And in `postHistory`, CreationDate is the date of each edit, so using MAX on that should give me the most recent one.  Alright, I think that covers both parts: how many times the post was edited and when it was last edited. </think>  SELECT COUNT(ph.PostId) AS PostHistoryCount, MAX(ph.CreationDate) AS LastEditDate FROM postHistory ph INNER JOIN posts p ON ph.PostId = p.Id WHERE p.Title = 'What is the best introductory Bayesian statistics textbook?'
SELECT U.LastAccessDate, U.Location  FROM Users U  INNER JOIN Badges B ON U.Id = B.UserId  WHERE B.Name = 'Outliers'; 
SELECT Title FROM posts WHERE Id IN (   SELECT RelatedPostId FROM postLinks WHERE PostId = (SELECT Id FROM posts WHERE Title = 'How to tell if something happened in a data set which monitors a value over time') ); 
SELECT p.Id AS PostId, NULL AS BadgeName FROM posts p JOIN users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id WHERE u.DisplayName = 'Samuel' AND YEAR(p.CreationDate) = 2013  UNION ALL  SELECT NULL AS PostId, b.Name AS BadgeName FROM badges b JOIN users u ON b.UserId = u.Id WHERE u.DisplayName = 'Samuel' AND YEAR(b.Date) = 2013; 
SELECT OwnerDisplayName FROM posts WHERE ViewCount = (SELECT MAX(ViewCount) FROM posts); 
SELECT u.DisplayName, u.Location FROM tags t INNER JOIN posts p ON t.ExcerptPostId = p.Id INNER JOIN users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id WHERE t.TagName = 'hypothesis-testing'; 
<think> Alright, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for related posts titles and link type IDs of the post titled "What are principal component scores?".  First, I should look at the database schema provided to understand which tables are involved. From the schema, I see that there are several tables: badges, comments, postHistory, postLinks, posts, tags, users, and votes.  The key here is to find related posts, so the table 'postLinks' seems relevant because it contains information about links between posts. The columns in postLinks include PostId, RelatedPostId, and LinkTypeId, which are exactly what the user needs—related post IDs and link type IDs.  Next, I need to get the titles of these related posts. The 'posts' table has a 'Title' column, so that's where I'll get the title from.   The process would involve two main steps: 1. Find the Id of the post titled "What are principal component scores?" in the 'posts' table. 2. Use that Id to find all related posts in the 'postLinks' table. From there, get the RelatedPostId and LinkTypeId.  But since I don't know the Id of the target post beforehand, I'll need to join the tables in a way that links "What are principal component scores?" to its related posts.  Wait, actually, the 'postLinks' table has both PostId and RelatedPostId. So if I'm looking for all posts related to the target post, either as PostId or RelatedPostId, I should consider both directions. But perhaps in this case, it's better to assume that the target post is the one in the PostId column, so we can get its RelatedPostIds.  Wait no, maybe not necessarily. Sometimes, a link could be in either direction. So to capture all related posts linked to the target post, whether it's as PostId or RelatedPostId, I should check both possibilities. But since the user is asking for related posts of "What are principal component scores?" perhaps it's sufficient to consider where that post is the source (i.e., in PostId).  Alternatively, maybe the link could be either way, so I might need a UNION to capture both cases.  But let's think again. The question is about the related posts titles and their link type IDs for "What are principal component scores?" So perhaps it's enough to find where 'PostId' is the target post's Id in the postLinks table, then get RelatedPostId and LinkTypeId from there.  So step by step:  1. Find the Id of the post with Title = 'What are principal component scores?' in the posts table.  2. Use that Id to query the postLinks table where PostId equals this Id, so we can get all related posts (RelatedPostId) and their LinkTypeId.  3. Then join back to the posts table on RelatedPostId to get the titles of those related posts.  Wait, but I think in SQL, I can do this with a JOIN between postLinks and posts twice: once for the source post and once for the target (related) post.  But actually, since we need the title of the related post, perhaps it's better to structure the query as follows:  - Start by selecting p1.Title as the source post's title, but wait no—actually, in this case, we're only interested in the titles of the related posts. So maybe I don't need p1.Title at all except for finding the Id.  Wait, let me clarify: The user wants the titles of the related posts and their link type IDs for "What are principal component scores?" So the main post is "What are principal component scores?", and we're looking for other posts that it links to. Therefore:  - Find the Id of the main post. - Use this Id in postLinks where PostId = main_post_id to get RelatedPostIds and LinkTypeIds. - Then, for each RelatedPostId, get their titles from the posts table.  So in SQL terms, I would join postLinks with posts on postLinks.RelatedPostId = posts.Id. But also, ensure that the main post's Id is correctly identified where its title matches 'What are principal component scores?'.  Putting it together:  SELECT p.Title, pl.LinkTypeId FROM postLinks pl JOIN posts p ON pl.RelatedPostId = p.Id WHERE pl.PostId = (SELECT Id FROM posts WHERE Title = 'What are principal component scores?')  Wait, but does the subquery correctly find the main post's Id? Yes, because it selects the Id where Title matches exactly.  Alternatively, I could use an INNER JOIN between postLinks and the posts table for both the source and target. Let me try that:  SELECT p2.Title, pl.LinkTypeId FROM postLinks pl INNER JOIN posts p1 ON pl.PostId = p1.Id INNER JOIN posts p2 ON pl.RelatedPostId = p2.Id WHERE p1.Title = 'What are principal component scores?'  This way, it's clearer: we're joining postLinks with the source post (p1) and the target post (p2), ensuring that p1 is our main post.  I think this approach is more efficient because it avoids a subquery. So the final SQL would select p2.Title and pl.LinkTypeId where p1's title matches.  Wait, but in the schema, the 'posts' table has an Id column which is the primary key, so that should work.  Therefore, the correct SQL would involve joining postLinks with posts twice: once on PostId and once on RelatedPostId, then filter where the source post's title is "What are principal component scores?". </think>  SELECT p2.Title, pl.LinkTypeId   FROM postLinks pl   INNER JOIN posts p1 ON pl.PostId = p1.Id   INNER JOIN posts p2 ON pl.RelatedPostId = p2.Id   WHERE p1.Title = 'What are principal component scores?';
SELECT u.DisplayName FROM (     SELECT ParentId     FROM posts     WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL     ORDER BY Score DESC     LIMIT 1 ) c JOIN posts p ON c.ParentId = p.Id JOIN users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id; 
SELECT u.DisplayName, u.WebsiteUrl  FROM votes v  JOIN users u ON v.UserId = u.Id  WHERE v.VoteTypeId = 8 AND v.BountyAmount = ( SELECT MAX(BountyAmount) FROM votes WHERE VoteTypeId = 8 ) 
SELECT Title FROM posts ORDER BY ViewCount DESC LIMIT 5; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tags WHERE Count BETWEEN 5000 AND 7000; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that finds the owner user ID of the most valuable post. From what I remember, the term "most valuable" here is defined by the maximum FavoriteCount. So, essentially, I'm looking for the post with the highest number in its FavoriteCount column and then retrieving the OwnerUserId associated with that post.  First, I should look at the database schema provided to understand which tables are involved. The posts table seems relevant because it contains both the FavoriteCount and the OwnerUserId columns. So, my focus will be on this table.  I need to write a SELECT statement that retrieves the OwnerUserId from the posts where the FavoriteCount is the highest. To get the maximum value of FavoriteCount, I can use the MAX() function in SQL. But how do I combine that with selecting the corresponding OwnerUserId?  Wait, if I just select MAX(FavoriteCount), that would give me the highest number. But I also need to get the OwnerUserId for that specific row. So, perhaps I should first find the maximum FavoriteCount and then query the posts table where FavoriteCount equals that value.  But wait, what if there are multiple posts with the same maximum FavoriteCount? In that case, would I return all of their OwnerUserIds or just one? The question seems to ask for the owner user ID, which suggests a single answer. Maybe in this context, it's acceptable to return one, even if there are ties.  So, my approach could be:  1. Find the maximum FavoriteCount by using MAX(FavoriteCount) on the posts table. 2. Then, select the OwnerUserId from posts where FavoriteCount equals that maximum value.  But how do I structure this in SQL? I can use a subquery to get the maximum first and then use it in the WHERE clause of the main query.  Alternatively, if I'm using a more advanced SQL version, perhaps I could sort the posts by FavoriteCount in descending order and pick the top one. But that might not be as straightforward for getting just the OwnerUserId.  Let me think about the structure:  SELECT OwnerUserId FROM posts WHERE FavoriteCount = (SELECT MAX(FavoriteCount) FROM posts);  Yes, this seems right. The subquery (SELECT MAX(FavoriteCount) FROM posts) will return the highest value of FavoriteCount. Then, the main query selects the OwnerUserId where the FavoriteCount matches that maximum.  I should also consider if there are any NULL values in FavoriteCount or OwnerUserId, but based on the schema, they might not be nullable, so it's probably safe to proceed without additional checks.  Another consideration: what if no posts have a FavoriteCount? But given the context, I suppose there is at least one post with a valid count, otherwise the query would return nothing. But since the question assumes that there's a most valuable post, that scenario should be handled.  Wait, looking back at the schema, the posts table has a column called Views but not sure if it relates to FavoriteCount. No, I think FavoriteCount is independent. So my approach remains valid.  I think this query should work: select OwnerUserId from posts where FavoriteCount equals the maximum value in that column. </think>  To find the owner user ID of the most valuable post, which is determined by the highest `FavoriteCount`, we can use a subquery to first determine the maximum value and then retrieve the corresponding `OwnerUserId`.  **Answer:**   SELECT OwnerUserId FROM posts WHERE FavoriteCount = (SELECT MAX(FavoriteCount) FROM posts);
<think> Alright, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question, "How old is the most influential user?" Let me break this down step by step.  First, understanding the terms: The "most influential" user would be the one with the highest reputation. So, I'm looking for the user who has the maximum Reputation value in the users table. Once I identify that user, I need to find their Age, which is stored in the same table.  Looking at the database schema provided, the `users` table indeed has both `Reputation` and `Age` columns. So, my task is to query this table to find the maximum Reputation and then get the corresponding Age of that user.  I should check if there are any nuances. For example, what if multiple users have the same highest Reputation? In such cases, I suppose we just need the Age of one of them since they all tie for the most influential. The question doesn't specify handling ties, so selecting the first one encountered should suffice.  Now, structuring the SQL query: I'll need to select the `Age` from the `users` table where the `Reputation` is the maximum value in that column. To do this efficiently, I can use a subquery to find the maximum Reputation and then select the Age of the user(s) with that Reputation.  Wait, but what if the maximum Reputation appears more than once? The question asks for "the most influential user," implying a single user, so perhaps we should limit it to one. However, since the question doesn't specify further criteria (like the oldest among them), I might just take the first occurrence or any one of them.  Putting it all together, the SQL query will look something like:  SELECT Age FROM users WHERE Reputation = (SELECT MAX(Reputation) FROM users);  This should work because the subquery selects the maximum Reputation value, and then the outer query fetches the Age of the user(s) with that Reputation. If there are multiple such users, this will return all their Ages, but since the question is about how old the most influential user is, it's likely expecting a single value, so perhaps adding LIMIT 1 would be appropriate.  But looking back at the problem statement, the extra knowledge mentions considering age and reputation. It doesn't specify that multiple users could tie for max Reputation, so maybe just selecting the Age where Reputation is maximum without a limit is acceptable. However, to ensure only one result, adding LIMIT 1 might make sense.  So, adjusting the query:  SELECT Age FROM users WHERE Reputation = (SELECT MAX(Reputation) FROM users) LIMIT 1;  But wait, in SQL, when you use a subquery like this, if there are multiple users with that max Reputation, without LIMIT 1, it will return all their Ages. But since the question is asking for "how old" the most influential user is, perhaps implying one answer, so maybe we need to handle cases where multiple users have the same max Reputation.  Alternatively, if the database design ensures that each Reputation is unique, but that's not necessarily true. So, to be safe, I think including LIMIT 1 would make sense to get just one Age value.  But looking at the example provided, the initial answer didn't include a limit, so perhaps it's acceptable to return all such users' Ages. However, since the question is phrased as "how old is the most influential user," expecting a single numerical answer, I think adding LIMIT 1 would be appropriate to ensure only one Age is returned.  But wait again. The problem statement says "only write sql with no comments," so I don't need to worry about explaining it. Also, considering that in SQL, some systems might not support LIMIT, but given the context, I'll assume it's acceptable here.  So, finalizing the query: Select Age from users where Reputation is equal to the maximum Reputation found in the users table and limit the result to one row. </think>  The most influential user is determined by having the highest reputation. To find their age:  SELECT Age FROM users WHERE Reputation = (SELECT MAX(Reputation) FROM users) LIMIT 1;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.Id) FROM votes v JOIN posts p ON v.PostId = p.Id WHERE YEAR(p.CreationDate) = 2011 AND v.BountyAmount = 50; 
SELECT Id FROM users WHERE Age IS NOT NULL ORDER BY Age ASC LIMIT 1; 
<think> Alright, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that calculates the sum of the scores of posts on '2010-07-19'. Let's break this down step by step.  First, I should identify which table contains the post scores and dates. Looking at the provided schema, the `posts` table has a `Score` column and a `LasActivityDate` column. That seems like the right place to start.  The user mentioned that 'on 2010-07-19' refers to `LasActivityDate` LIKE '2010-07-19%'. So I need to filter posts where the `LasActivityDate` is on that specific date. That means using a WHERE clause with a LIKE condition to match any time on that day.  Next, I want to sum up the scores of these filtered posts. The SQL function SUM() will handle that for me, and since we're dealing with potentially multiple rows, this aggregate function makes sense.  Putting it all together, my query should select the sum of `Score` from `posts` where `LasActivityDate` is on '2010-07-19'. So I'll write something like:  SELECT SUM(Score) FROM posts WHERE LasActivityDate LIKE '2010-07-19%';  I need to make sure that the date format matches exactly what's in the database. Since the example uses a string with single quotes and the exact date, using LIKE ensures we capture any entries from that day regardless of the time component.  Wait, is `LasActivityDate` spelled correctly? In the schema, it's written as `LasActivityDate`. Sometimes people might misspell it as `LastActivityDate`, but according to the provided schema, it's indeed `LasActivityDate`.  Also, since SUM() returns a single value, this query will give me one number which is the total score for that day.  I don't think I need any joins here because all the necessary information is in the `posts` table. The other tables like `votes` or `users` aren't required unless we needed additional data, but in this case, they're not relevant.  So, to recap: Use SUM on the Score column, filter by LasActivityDate using LIKE '2010-07-19%', and that's it. </think>  SELECT SUM(Score) FROM posts WHERE LasActivityDate LIKE '2010-07-19%';
SELECT COUNT(pl.Id) / 12  FROM postLinks pl INNER JOIN posts p ON pl.PostId = p.Id WHERE YEAR(pl.CreationDate) = 2010 AND p.AnswerCount <= 2; 
SELECT v.PostId FROM votes v INNER JOIN posts p ON v.PostId = p.Id WHERE v.UserId = 1465 GROUP BY v.PostId ORDER BY MAX(p.FavoriteCount) DESC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT p.Title  FROM posts p JOIN postLinks pl ON p.Id = pl.PostId ORDER BY pl.CreationDate ASC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT DisplayName FROM users WHERE Id = ( SELECT UserId FROM badges GROUP BY UserId ORDER BY COUNT(Name) DESC LIMIT 1 ); 
SELECT MIN(CreationDate) AS FirstVoteDate FROM votes WHERE UserId = (SELECT Id FROM users WHERE DisplayName = 'chl'); 
SELECT MIN(p.CreaionDate)  FROM users u JOIN posts p ON u.Id = p.OwnerUserId WHERE u.Age = (SELECT MIN(Age) FROM users); 
SELECT u.DisplayName  FROM badges b JOIN users u ON b.UserId = u.Id WHERE b.Name = 'Autobiographer' ORDER BY b.Date ASC  LIMIT 1; 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.OwnerUserId)  FROM posts p JOIN users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id WHERE u.Location = 'United Kingdom' AND p.FavoriteCount >= 4; 
SELECT AVG(num_votes) AS average_posts_voted FROM (   SELECT u.id, COUNT(v.userid) as num_votes   FROM users u   LEFT JOIN votes v ON u.id = v.userid   WHERE u.age = (SELECT MAX(age) FROM users)   GROUP BY u.id ) sub; 
SELECT DisplayName FROM users WHERE Reputation = (SELECT MAX(Reputation) FROM users); 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how many users have a reputation higher than 2000 and more than 1000 views. Let me start by looking at the database schema provided.  First, the relevant table here is the `users` table because it contains information about each user, including their Reputation and Views. The columns we're interested in are `Reputation` and `Views`.  The question specifies two conditions: Reputation must be greater than 2000, and Views must be greater than 1000. So I need to count the number of rows in the users table where both these conditions are met.  I should use a SELECT statement with a COUNT function to get the number of users. The FROM clause will specify the users table. Then, I'll add a WHERE clause that filters the results based on Reputation > 2000 and Views > 1000.   Wait, looking at the schema again, I notice that in the `users` table, both Reputation and Views are stored as integers, so comparing them with the given numbers should work without any issues.  Putting it all together, the SQL query should select the count of user IDs where Reputation is greater than 2000 and Views are greater than 1000. That should give me the exact number of users that meet both criteria. </think>  SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM `users` WHERE Reputation > 2000 AND Views > 1000;
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that lists all the display names of users who are considered adults. From the problem statement, I understand that an adult is defined as someone whose age is between 19 and 65 inclusive.  Looking at the database schema provided, there's a `users` table which includes a column named `Age`. The `DisplayName` is also in this table. So, my task is to select the `DisplayName` from the `users` table where the `Age` falls within the specified range.  First, I should check if the `Age` column exists and if it's an integer because the BETWEEN clause in SQL works with numbers. From the schema, yes, `Age` is an INTEGER, so that's good.  Next, I need to construct the SELECT statement. Since we're only interested in the display names, I'll select `DisplayName`. The FROM clause will be the `users` table.  Now, the WHERE clause needs to filter users where Age is between 19 and 65. So, I'll use `Age BETWEEN 19 AND 65`. This should cover all users who are adults as per the given criteria.  I also need to consider if there are any NULL values in the Age column. If a user's age isn't provided, they won't be included because the condition specifically looks for ages between 19 and 65. So, it's safe to proceed without additional checks unless I want to handle NULLs differently, but the problem doesn't mention that.  Putting it all together, the SQL query should select `DisplayName` from `users` where `Age` is between 19 and 65. That should give me exactly what's needed. </think>  SELECT DisplayName FROM users WHERE Age BETWEEN 19 AND 65;
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM posts WHERE OwnerUserId = (SELECT Id FROM users WHERE DisplayName = 'Jay Stevens') AND YEAR(CreationDate) = 2010; 
SELECT p.Id, p.Title FROM posts p INNER JOIN users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id WHERE u.DisplayName = 'Harvey Motulsky' ORDER BY p.ViewCount DESC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT Id, Title FROM posts ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT AVG(p.Score)  FROM users u  JOIN posts p ON u.Id = p.OwnerUserId  WHERE u.DisplayName = 'Stephen Turner'; 
SELECT DISTINCT u.DisplayName  FROM Users u INNER JOIN Posts p ON u.Id = p.OwnerUserId WHERE p.ViewCount > 20000 AND YEAR(p.CreationDate) = 2011; 
SELECT p.Id, u.DisplayName  FROM posts p  JOIN users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id  WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', p.CreationDate) = '2010'  ORDER BY p.FavoriteCount DESC  LIMIT 1; 
SELECT      CAST(         COUNT(CASE WHEN u.Reputation > 1000 THEN p.Id END) AS FLOAT      ) / COUNT(p.Id) * 100 AS Percentage FROM posts p JOIN users u ON p.OwnerUserId = u.Id WHERE YEAR(p.CreationDate) = 2011; 
SELECT CAST(COUNT(Id) AS float) * 100 / (SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM users) AS percentage FROM users WHERE Age BETWEEN 13 AND 18; 
SELECT      p.Views AS Views,     u.DisplayName AS DisplayName FROM      posts p INNER JOIN      users u ON p.UserId = u.Id WHERE      p.Title LIKE '%data analysis%' OR p.Content LIKE '%data analysis%'; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts WHERE ViewCount > (SELECT AVG(ViewCount) FROM posts); 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM comments WHERE postid IN (SELECT id FROM posts WHERE score = (SELECT MAX(score) FROM posts)); 
SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM posts WHERE ViewCount > 35000 AND CommentCount = 0; 
SELECT u.DisplayName, u.Location  FROM users u  INNER JOIN posts p ON u.Id = p.LastEditorUserId  WHERE p.Id = 183;
