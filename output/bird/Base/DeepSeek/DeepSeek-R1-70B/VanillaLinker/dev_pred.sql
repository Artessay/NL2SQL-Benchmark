SELECT MAX(`Free Meal Count (K-12)` / `Enrollment (K-12)`) AS max_eligible_rate  FROM frpm  WHERE `County Name` = 'Alameda'  AND `Enrollment (K-12)` > 0  AND `Free Meal Count (K-12)` > 0; 
SELECT      `School Name`,     (`Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) AS EligibleFreeRate FROM      frpm WHERE      `Educational Option Type` = 'Continuation'     AND `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` > 0 ORDER BY      EligibleFreeRate ASC LIMIT 3; 
SELECT s.Zip  FROM frpm f INNER JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE f.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 AND s.County = 'Fresno'; 
SELECT T2.MailStreet  FROM frpm AS T1  INNER JOIN schools AS T2  ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode  WHERE T1.`FRPM Count (K-12)` IS NOT NULL  ORDER BY T1.`FRPM Count (K-12)` DESC  LIMIT 1; 
SELECT s.Phone  FROM frpm f  INNER JOIN schools s  ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode  WHERE f.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 AND s.FundingType = 'Direct Charter' AND s.OpenDate > '2000-01-01'; 
<think> Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this SQL query. The user wants to know how many schools have an average math SAT score greater than 400 and are exclusively virtual, which means their Virtual field is set to 'F'.   First, I need to identify the relevant tables. The satscores table has the SAT data, including AvgScrMath, which is the average math score. The schools table contains information about each school, including whether it's virtual.  I should join these two tables on the CDSCode since that's the common identifier between them. Using an INNER JOIN makes sense here because we need matching records in both tables.  Next, I'll set up the WHERE clause to filter for AvgScrMath > 400 and Virtual = 'F'. This ensures we only count schools meeting both criteria.  Finally, I'll use COUNT(*) to tally the number of qualifying schools and alias it as NumSchools for clarity. Putting it all together, the SQL query should join the tables, apply the filters, and count the results. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumSchools FROM satscores INNER JOIN schools ON satscores.cds = schools.CDSCode WHERE AvgScrMath > 400 AND Virtual = 'F'
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.  The question is: Among the schools with SAT test takers over 500, list those that are magnet schools or offer a magnet program. From the extra knowledge provided, I know that being a magnet school means the Magnet field in the schools table is 1.  Looking at the database schema, I see three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The relevant data here is split between satscores and schools.  First, I need to find schools where the number of SAT test takers (NumTstTakr) is greater than 500. That information is in the satscores table. So, I'll select from satscores where NumTstTakr > 500.  Next, these schools must be magnet schools or offer a magnet program. The Magnet field in the schools table indicates this with a value of 1. Therefore, I need to join the satscores table with the schools table on the CDSCode field since that's the primary key common to both tables.  I should use an INNER JOIN to combine these two tables. This way, I only get records where both tables have matching CDSCodes.  Now, I want specific information about each school. The user probably wants the school name and maybe some identifiers. So, I'll include sname (school name), cds (CDSCode from satscores), and perhaps dname (district name) for clarity, though the question doesn't specify needing district info. But since sname is in satscores, that's sufficient.  Putting it all together, my SELECT statement will include sname, cds, and maybe dname to make the output informative. The FROM clause starts with satscores, then INNER JOINs with schools on CDSCode. The WHERE clauses are NumTstTakr > 500 and Magnet = 1.  I should double-check if there are any other conditions or joins needed, but from what I can tell, this covers the requirements. </think>  SELECT sname, cds, dname FROM satscores INNER JOIN schools ON satscores.cds = schools.CDSCode WHERE NumTstTakr > 500 AND Magnet = 1;
SELECT s.Phone FROM schools s INNER JOIN satscores sa ON s.CDSCode = sa.cds WHERE sa.NumGE1500 = (SELECT MAX(NumGE1500) FROM satscores) LIMIT 1; 
SELECT SUM(s.NumTstTakr) AS TotalTestTakers FROM satscores s WHERE s.cds IN (     SELECT f.CDSCode     FROM frpm f     WHERE `FRPM Count (K-12)` = (         SELECT MAX(`FRPM Count (K-12)`)         FROM frpm     ) ); 
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM satscores s JOIN frpm f ON s.CDSCode = f.CDSCode WHERE s.AvgScrMath > 560 AND f.CharterSchoolYN = 1; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers this specific question: "For the school with the highest average score in Reading in the SAT test, what is its FRPM count for students aged 5-17?"   Let me break it down step by step.  First, I know there are three tables involved: frpm, satscores, and schools. The question is asking about a school's FRPM count from the frpm table, but to get that, I need information from both satscores and frpm because the highest average reading score comes from satscores.  So, step one is to find which school has the highest average reading score. In the satscores table, the relevant column for reading is AvgScrRead. I'll need to find the maximum value of this column. That will give me the top score.  Once I have that score, I can get the CDSCode (which is the primary key) from the satscores table where the AvgScrRead equals that maximum value. But wait, what if there are multiple schools with the same highest average? Hmm, the question doesn't specify handling ties, so maybe it's safe to assume there's a single school or we just pick one.  Next, I need to link this CDSCode to the frpm table because that's where FRPM counts are stored. Specifically, the column is 'FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)'. So, I'll join satscores and frpm on their CDSCode fields.  Wait, actually, in the schools table, each school has a CDSCode which is a primary key. Both satscores and frpm reference this CDSCode via foreign keys. So, to get from satscores to frpm, I can use the CDSCode as the common key.  Here's how it might go:  1. Select the maximum AvgScrRead from satscores. 2. Find the CDSCode(s) associated with that maximum value. 3. Use that CDSCode to find the corresponding FRPM count in frpm.  So, I can structure this with a subquery. The inner query finds the max average reading score and then gets the CDSCode where AvgScrRead equals that max. Then the outer query selects the FRPM count from frpm where CDSCode matches.  Wait, but in SQL, sometimes when you have multiple columns, you might need to aggregate or group, but here we just want a single value—the highest average—and its corresponding school's CDSCode. So, maybe using MAX and then selecting the CDSCode with that MAX.  Putting it together:  SELECT `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` FROM frpm WHERE CDSCode = ( SELECT cds FROM satscores WHERE AvgScrRead = ( SELECT MAX(AvgScrRead) FROM satscores ) )  But wait, what if there are multiple schools with the same highest average? The subquery would return multiple CDSCodes, but the outer query expects a single value. In that case, maybe I should limit it to one or use another method.  Alternatively, since each CDSCode is unique (as it's a primary key in all tables), there shouldn't be duplicates. So, perhaps it's safe as is.  Another approach could be ordering by AvgScrRead descending and taking the first row's CDSCode, then using that to get the FRPM count.  Like:  SELECT `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` FROM frpm WHERE CDSCode = (     SELECT cds FROM satscores ORDER BY AvgScrRead DESC LIMIT 1 )  But which method is better? Using MAX might be more efficient because it doesn't require ordering all records, just finding the maximum. But both should work.  I think using MAX is clearer in intent here. So I'll go with the first approach. </think>  SELECT `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` FROM frpm WHERE CDSCode = ( SELECT cds FROM satscores WHERE AvgScrRead = ( SELECT MAX(AvgScrRead) FROM satscores ) )
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's request. The question is asking for the codes of schools where the total enrollment exceeds 500. From the extra knowledge provided, I know that the total enrollment should be calculated by adding two fields: `Enrollment (K-12)` and `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`.   First, I'll look at the database schema to see which tables have these enrollment fields. The `frpm` table has both `Enrollment (K-12)` and `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` columns. So, my query will focus on this table.  I need to select the primary key from the `frpm` table since the question asks for school codes. The primary key here is `CDSCode`.  Next, I'll set up the condition in the WHERE clause. The sum of the two enrollment fields should be greater than 500. So, the condition will be `[Enrollment (K-12)] + [Enrollment (Ages 5-17)] > 500`.   I should also consider if there are any NULL values in these columns because adding NULL could affect the result. However, since the user didn't specify handling NULLs, I'll proceed without additional checks unless it's necessary.  Putting it all together, the SQL query will select `CDSCode` from `frpm` where the sum of enrollments exceeds 500. </think>  SELECT CDSCode FROM frpm WHERE [Enrollment (K-12)] + [Enrollment (Ages 5-17)] > 500
SELECT MAX(`Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) AS max_free_rate FROM satscores INNER JOIN frpm ON cds = CDSCode WHERE (NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr) > 0.3 AND `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` > 0; 
SELECT s.Phone FROM schools s JOIN satscores sa ON s.CDSCode = sa.cds WHERE sa.NumGE1500 IS NOT NULL AND sa.NumTstTakr > 0 ORDER BY (sa.NumGE1500 / sa.NumTstTakr) DESC LIMIT 3; 
SELECT s.NCESSchool, f.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` FROM frpm f JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode ORDER BY f.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` DESC LIMIT 5; 
SELECT district FROM (   SELECT scho.District AS district, AVG(sat.AvgScrRead) AS avg_read_score   FROM schools scho   JOIN satscores sat ON scho.CDSCode = sat.cds   WHERE scho.StatusType = 'Active'   GROUP BY scho.District   ORDER BY avg_read_score DESC ) AS subquery WHERE ROWNUM <= 1; 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.CDSCode)  FROM frpm f  INNER JOIN satscores sa ON f.CDSCode = sa.cds  INNER JOIN schools sc ON sa.cds = sc.CDSCode  WHERE sc.County = 'Alameda' AND sa.NumTstTakr < 100; 
<think> Alright, let me break down how I arrived at the SQL query for the user's question.  First, the user wants to rank schools based on their average writing scores where the score exceeds 499 and also display their charter numbers. They mentioned that a valid charter number isn't null, so I need to include only those schools where `CharterNum` is not null.  Looking at the database schema, the `satscores` table holds the SAT data, including `AvgScrWrite`, which is the average writing score. The `schools` table contains the `CharterNum` and other school details. Since both tables have `CDSCode` as a primary key, I can join them on this field to access data from both.  I need to filter schools where `AvgScrWrite` > 499. Also, `CharterNum` shouldn't be null, so I'll include that condition in the WHERE clause.   To rank the schools, using `ORDER BY AvgScrWrite DESC` makes sense because higher scores should come first. This way, the schools are listed from highest to lowest average writing score.  I have to make sure to select only the necessary columns: school name (`School`), average writing score (`AvgScrWrite`), and charter number (`CharterNum`).   Putting it all together, I'll join the two tables on `CDSCode`, apply the filters, and sort the results accordingly. </think>  SELECT s.School, ss.AvgScrWrite, s.CharterNum FROM schools s JOIN satscores ss ON s.CDSCode = ss.cds WHERE ss.AvgScrWrite > 499 AND s.CharterNum IS NOT NULL ORDER BY ss.AvgScrWrite DESC;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.CDSCode) FROM satscores sc INNER JOIN schools s ON sc.cds = s.CDSCode WHERE sc.rtype = 'S'   AND s.County = 'Fresno'   AND s.FundingType = 'Directly Funded'   AND sc.NumTstTakr <= 250; 
SELECT s.Phone FROM schools s WHERE s.CDSCode IN (SELECT sa.cds FROM satscores sa WHERE sa.rtype = 'S' AND sa.AvgScrMath = (SELECT MAX(AvgScrMath) FROM satscores WHERE rtype = 'S')); 
SELECT COUNT(CDSCode)  FROM frpm  WHERE `County Name` = 'Amador' AND `Low Grade` = '9' AND `High Grade` = '12'; 
SELECT COUNT(CDSCode) FROM frpm WHERE `County Name` = 'Los Angeles' AND `Free Meal Count (K-12)` > 500 AND `FRPM Count (K-12)` < 700; 
SELECT      s.School,     SUM(sa.NumTstTakr) as total_takers FROM      schools s INNER JOIN      satscores sa ON s.CDSCode = sa.cds WHERE      s.County = 'Contra Costa' GROUP BY      s.School ORDER BY      total_takers DESC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT s.School, s.Street || ', ' || s.City || ', ' || s.Zip AS Address FROM frpm f INNER JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE (f.`Enrollment (K-12)` - f.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) > 30; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me break it down step by step.  First, the user is asking for the names of schools that meet two specific criteria:  1. The percentage of students eligible for free meals in K-12 is more than 0.1. 2. The number of test takers with scores greater than or equal to 1500 is at least a certain amount. Wait, actually, looking back, the question says "test takers whose test score is greater than or equal to 1500." So I think it's about the count being non-zero or meeting some threshold.  Looking at the database schema provided:  - There are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. - The 'frpm' table has information about free meal eligibility. It includes columns like 'Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)', which is named as 'PercentEligibleFreeK12'. So that's where the first condition comes from. - The 'satscores' table has test-related data, including 'NumGE1500', which I assume stands for Number of students who scored 1500 or above. So this is the second condition.  The schools' names are in both 'frpm' and 'schools' tables as 'School Name' and 'School', respectively.  Now, to join these tables correctly. Each table has a CDSCode which links them. So I'll need to join frpm with satscores on CDSCode, but since the schools table also contains CDSCode, maybe I should join all three or just the necessary ones. Wait, actually, in the schema, 'frpm' and 'satscores' both reference 'schools' via their foreign keys, so each has CDSCode as primary key which links to schools.  But for this query, since we're selecting the school name from either frpm or schools, perhaps I can join frpm with satscores directly. Wait, looking at the tables, 'frpm' and 'satscores' both have CDSCode as their primary keys? No, wait: in frpm, it's TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, same for satscores, cds is TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY. So yes, they can be joined on CDSCode.  So the plan is:  1. Select 'School Name' from frpm where PercentEligibleFreeK12 > 0.1. 2. Join with satscores where NumGE1500 >= some number. Wait, but what's the condition exactly? The user says "test takers whose test score is greater than or equal to 1500." So it's about having at least one such student, so maybe NumGE1500 > 0. Or perhaps they require a specific count, but since the question isn't clear on that, I think we just need to ensure that there are any students with scores >=1500.  Wait, looking back at the satscores table, 'NumGE1500' is INTEGER and can be NULL. So in the query, I should include where NumGE1500 > 0 or IS NOT NULL? Hmm, but if it's zero, then no test takers met that score. So perhaps the condition is NumGE1500 IS NOT NULL AND >=1.  But maybe the user just wants schools where there are any such test takers. Alternatively, perhaps they need to have at least some number, say more than zero.  Wait, looking back, the question says "test takers whose test score is greater than or equal to 1500." So it's about having at least one such test taker. Therefore, in 'satscores', we need to find schools where NumGE1500 >=1.  But wait, looking at the satscores table, 'NumGE1500' can be NULL if there are no such students. So perhaps the condition should be NumGE1500 > 0. Alternatively, if it's NULL, that means zero or not applicable.  Wait, but in the data, if a school has zero test takers scoring >=1500, then 'NumGE1500' would probably be 0, not NULL. But some schools might not have any SAT data at all, so maybe they don't appear in satscores. Therefore, to include only schools that have at least one such test taker, we can join on CDSCode and set the condition as NumGE1500 >=1.  Wait, but if a school isn't present in satscores, it means they didn't have any SAT data. So when joining, using an INNER JOIN would exclude those schools without any SAT scores.  But wait, the question is about schools that have both: percent eligible free meals > 0.1 and at least one test taker with score >=1500. Therefore, we need to join frpm with satscores on CDSCode where NumGE1500 >=1.  Additionally, since each school's name appears in 'frpm' as SchoolName, I can select that directly without needing the schools table.  Wait, let me check: 'frpm' has 'School Name'? Or does it? Looking back at the schema, the column is named 'School Name' (yes, in frpm). So yes, we can get the name from there.  So putting it all together:  - Select SchoolName from frpm. - Join with satscores on CDSCode. - Apply conditions: PercentEligibleFreeK12 > 0.1 and NumGE1500 >=1.  Also, since in SQL, column names might have spaces, so we need to use quotes or brackets. For example, 'Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)' would be written as "PercentEligibleFreeK12" if it's an alias or using the actual name with proper formatting.  Wait, looking at the frpm table schema, the column is named:  'Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)'  So in SQL, when referencing this column, I have to use square brackets or quotes. So [Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)] > 0.1  Similarly, 'NumGE1500' is a column name without spaces.  Therefore, the SQL query would be:  SELECT f.[School Name] FROM frpm f JOIN satscores s ON f.CDSCode = s.cds WHERE f.[Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)] > 0.1 AND s.NumGE1500 >= 1;  Wait, but in the satscores table, the CDSCode is named 'cds', so in lowercase? Or is it 'CDSCode'? Looking back: the satscores table has 'cds' as TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY. So yes, it's lowercase.  So in the JOIN, we have to match f.CDSCode with s.cds. But wait, are they case-sensitive? In SQL Server, object names are case-insensitive by default, but string comparisons can be case-sensitive. However, when joining on columns, it's typically better to ensure that the join is correct regardless of case.  But in this case, I think the CDSCode in frpm and satscores should match exactly, so perhaps the join is fine as f.CDSCode = s.cds, assuming that the data uses the same case.  Alternatively, maybe it's better to use a case-insensitive comparison or convert both sides to uppercase. But for simplicity, I'll proceed with f.CDSCode = s.cds.  Wait, but in frpm, CDSCode is capitalized as 'CDSCode', while in satscores, it's 'cds'. So when joining, we have to match the column names correctly.  So perhaps the correct join condition is f.CDSCode = s.cds. So that's correct.  Putting it all together:  SELECT f.[School Name] FROM frpm f INNER JOIN satscores s ON f.CDSCode = s.cds WHERE f.[Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)] > 0.1 AND s.NumGE1500 >= 1;  Wait, but the user just wants schools where both conditions are met: percent eligible free meals in K-12 is more than 0.1 and test takers with scores >=1500. So this query should do that.  I think that's it. So the final SQL statement selects the school names from frpm where the percentage is over 0.1, joined with satscores where NumGE1500 is at least 1. </think>  SELECT f.[School Name] FROM frpm f INNER JOIN satscores s ON f.CDSCode = s.cds WHERE f.[Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)] > 0.1 AND s.NumGE1500 >= 1;
SELECT SchoolName, FundingType FROM schools WHERE County = 'SpecificCounty'; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me break it down step by step.  First, the user is asking for the names and full communication addresses of high schools in Monterey that have more than 800 free or reduced price meals (FRPM) for ages 15-17.   Looking at the database schema provided, I see three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The relevant information seems to be split between these tables.  1. **Identifying the Correct Table**: The FRPM data is in the 'frpm' table. Specifically, the column 'FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)' holds the count of free or reduced price meals for that age group.  2. **Determining High Schools**: To identify high schools, I need a way to distinguish them from other types of schools. The 'School Type' in the frpm table could help, but it's NULL often. Another approach is the 'High Grade' column in frpm or possibly the 'GSoffered' in schools, which might indicate grade levels.  3. **Location Information**: The full communication address includes Street, City, State, and Zip. This information is in the 'schools' table under Street, City, State, and Zip columns.  4. **Joining Tables**: Since both frpm and schools contain necessary info, I'll need to join them on their common key. Both have CDSCode as a primary key, so that's the link.  5. **Filtering Monterey County**: The 'County Name' in frpm should be 'Monterey'.  6. **Handling NULLs**: Some columns might have NULL values, especially in the schools table for address fields. I'll use COALESCE to handle NULLs and provide a placeholder like 'N/A' if necessary.  7. **Selecting Columns**: I need School Name from frpm (aliased as s_name) and all address components from schools.  Putting it all together, I join frpm and schools on CDSCode, filter by Monterey County, check that FRPM Count for ages 5-17 is over 800, handle NULLs in address fields, and select the required columns. </think>  SELECT      s.School,     COALESCE(frs.`School Name`, 'N/A') AS s_name,     COALESCE(s.Street, 'N/A'),     COALESCE(s.City, 'N/A'),     COALESCE(s.State, 'N/A'),     COALESCE(s.Zip, 'N/A') FROM `frpm` frs JOIN schools s ON frs.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE frs.`County Name` = 'Monterey' AND frs.`FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` > 800
<think> Alright, I need to tackle this SQL query problem. Let me read through the question again carefully.  The user wants to find the average writing score for schools that were either opened after 1991 or closed before 2000. They also want the school names along with the scores and the phone numbers if available.  First, I'll look at the database schema provided. The main tables involved seem to be 'schools', 'frpm', and 'satscores'. Since the question is about SAT writing scores, I should focus on the 'satscores' table because that's where the test data is stored.  Next, I need to link this with the 'schools' table because it contains information about when schools opened or closed. The 'OpenDate' and 'ClosedDate' fields are in the 'schools' table, so I'll need to join these two tables on their common key, which is CDSCode. The 'satscores' table uses 'cds' as its primary key, which corresponds to 'CDSCode' in the other tables.  The question mentions two conditions: schools opened after 1991 or closed before 2000. So I'll set up a WHERE clause that checks if OpenDate is after '1991-12-31' (which effectively means any date in 1992 or later) OR ClosedDate is before '2000-01-01'.  I need to calculate the average writing score, which is stored as 'AvgScrWrite' in 'satscores'. I'll use the AVG() function for this and group the results by school name from the 'schools' table.  Additionally, the user wants the phone number if available. The 'Phone' field in the 'schools' table holds that information, so I'll include it in the SELECT statement.  Putting it all together, I'll write a SQL query that joins the two tables on CDSCode, applies the date conditions, groups by school name, and selects the required fields.  I should also make sure to handle cases where AvgScrWrite might be NULL or where Phone is not available. Using COALESCE can help format NULLs as 'N/A' for clarity, but since the user didn't specify, I'll note that but proceed without it unless instructed otherwise.  Finally, I'll structure the query to include all necessary components: joining tables, filtering with WHERE, grouping, and selecting the required data. </think>  SELECT s.SchoolName, AVG(sa.AvgScrWrite) AS AverageWritingScore, s.Phone FROM schools s INNER JOIN satscores sa ON s.CDSCode = sa.cds WHERE OpenDate > '1991-12-31' OR ClosedDate < '2000-01-01' GROUP BY s.SchoolName
WITH avg_diff AS (   SELECT AVG(f.Enrollment_K12 - f.Enrollment_Ages_5_17) AS avg_diff   FROM frpm f   INNER JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode   WHERE s.FundingType = 'Local' ) SELECT s.School, s.DOCType FROM frpm f INNER JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE s.FundingType = 'Local' AND (f.[Enrollment (K-12)] - f.[Enrollment (Ages 5-17)]) > (SELECT avg_diff FROM avg_diff); 
SELECT s.OpenDate FROM frpm f JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE f.`Enrollment (K-12)` = (SELECT MAX(`Enrollment (K-12)`) FROM frpm) LIMIT 1; 
<think> Alright, let's tackle this SQL problem. The user is asking which cities have the top 5 lowest enrollment numbers for students in grades 1 through 12. From the provided schema, I know that K-12 refers to grades 1 through 12.  First, I need to find the right table with enrollment data. Looking at the tables, `frpm` has a column `Enrollment (K-12)` which is exactly what we need. So, the main focus will be on this table.  Next, the user wants the cities. The city information isn't directly in `frpm`; it's in the `schools` table under the `City` column. Therefore, I should join these two tables to link the enrollment data with city names.  To join them, both tables have a common key: `CDSCode` in `frpm` and `CDSCode` in `schools`. So, an INNER JOIN on `CDSCode` makes sense here.  Now, I need to order the results. Since we're looking for the lowest enrollments, I'll sort by `Enrollment (K-12)` in ascending order.  To get the top 5, I should limit the query to return only five entries. Using LIMIT 5 at the end of the query will handle that.  Putting it all together, I'll select the city from `schools`, join with `frpm` on their CDSCode, order by enrollment ascending, and limit the results to five. This should give me the cities with the top 5 lowest enrollments. </think>  SELECT City FROM schools INNER JOIN frpm ON schools.CDSCode = frpm.CDSCode ORDER BY `Enrollment (K-12)` ASC LIMIT 5
SELECT      s.SchoolName,     (f.`Free Meal Count (K-12)` / f.`Enrollment (K-12)`) AS EligibleFreeRate FROM (     SELECT          CDSCode,         SchoolName,         `Enrollment (K-12)`,         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY `Enrollment (K-12)` DESC) AS Rank     FROM frpm ) s WHERE Rank IN (10, 11); 
<think> Alright, so I need to help the user by writing an SQL query based on their question. Let me break down what they're asking.  The question is: "What is the eligible free or reduced price meal rate for the top 5 schools in grades 1-12 with the highest free or reduced price meal count of the schools with the ownership code 66?"  First, I need to understand the database schema. There are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The relevant columns seem to be in the frpm table because it contains information about Free Meal counts and Enrollment.  The user mentions "grades 1-12" but notes that this corresponds to "K-12". So I should use columns like `FRPM Count (K-12)` and `Enrollment (K-12)` from the frpm table.  They want the top 5 schools by FRPM count, so I'll need to sort by `FRPM Count (K-12)` in descending order and limit the results to 5. Also, these schools must have an ownership code of 66. Looking at the schema, I think the "ownership code" might be in the 'EdOpsCode' column in the schools table because that's a common place for such codes.  Wait, actually, checking the schools table, there are several code fields like EdOpsCode and EILCode. The user didn't specify which one is the ownership code, but since '66' is often used as a district code or something similar, perhaps it's stored in 'EdOpsCode'. Alternatively, maybe it's in the 'County Code' or another field. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll proceed with 'EdOpsCode' for now.  So, to get the ownership code 66, I need to join the frpm table with the schools table on CDSCode and filter where EdOpsCode = '66'.   The eligible rate is calculated as FRPM Count divided by Enrollment. So in SQL, it would be `FRPM Count (K-12)` / `Enrollment (K-12)`.  Putting this together, I should select the School Name, FRPM Count, and the calculated rate from frpm, join with schools on CDSCode, filter where EdOpsCode is 66, order by FRPM count descending, and limit to top 5.  Wait a second, in the frpm table, 'School Name' is a column. So I can directly select it without needing the schools table for that. But since the ownership code is in the schools table, I do need to join.  So the SQL structure would be:  SELECT      s.Name,     f.FRPC,     (f.FRPM / f.Enrollment) as Rate FROM frpm f JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE s.EdOpsCode = '66' ORDER BY f.FRPM DESC LIMIT 5;  But I need to ensure the correct column names. Looking back, in frpm, it's `FRPM Count (K-12)` and `Enrollment (K-12)`. So I'll use those exact names.  Also, checking if EdOpsCode is the right field for ownership code 66. If it isn't, maybe it's another column like 'County Code' or something else. But without more info, I'll proceed with EdOpsCode.  So final query would select School Name, FRPM Count, calculate the rate, join on CDSCode, filter EdOpsCode = 66, order by FRPM count descending, and limit to 5. </think>  SELECT `School Name`, `FRPM Count (K-12)`, (`FRPM Count (K-12)` / `Enrollment (K-12)`) AS EligibleFreeRate FROM frpm WHERE `EdOpsCode` = '66' ORDER BY `FRPM Count (K-12)` DESC LIMIT 5
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me break down what they're asking for.  The user wants to find the website addresses of schools where the free meal count for students aged 5-17 is between 1,900 and 2,000. They also want the school names included in the results.  First, I should identify which table contains the relevant information. The 'frpm' table has a column called 'Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)' which seems to be what we need. This table also has the 'School Name', so that's good because the user wants both the website and school name.  However, the 'Website' field isn't in the 'frpm' table; it's in the 'schools' table. So I'll need to join these two tables on a common key. Both tables have a 'CDSCode' column which is the primary key for the 'frpm' and 'schools' tables, so that will be my joining point.  Next, I'll set up the SELECT statement to include 'Website' from 'schools' and 'School Name' from 'frpm'. Then, I'll use an INNER JOIN between 'frpm' and 'schools' on their 'CDSCode' fields.  Now, the WHERE clause needs to filter where 'Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)' is between 1,900 and 2,000. So I'll write that condition to ensure only those rows are selected.  Putting it all together, I structure the query to select the required columns, join the tables, and apply the necessary condition. </think>  SELECT s.Website, f.`School Name` FROM frpm f INNER JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE f.`Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` BETWEEN 1900 AND 2000
SELECT      (T1.`Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / T1.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) * 100 AS FreeRate FROM frpm T1 JOIN schools T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode WHERE      (T2.AdmFName1 = 'Kacey' AND T2.AdmLName1 = 'Gibson')     OR (T2.AdmFName2 = 'Kacey' AND T2.AdmLName2 = 'Gibson')     OR (T2.AdmFName3 = 'Kacey' AND T2.AdmLName3 = 'Gibson'); 
SELECT T2.AdmEmail1 || T2.AdmEmail2 || T2.AdmEmail3 AS Administrator_Email FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode WHERE T1.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 AND T1.`Enrollment (K-12)` = (     SELECT MIN(`Enrollment (K-12)`)     FROM frpm     WHERE `Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 ) LIMIT 1; 
SELECT s.AdmFName1, s.AdmLName1, s.AdmFName2, s.AdmLName2, s.AdmFName3, s.AdmLName3  FROM schools s  WHERE s.CDSCode IN (   SELECT sc.cds    FROM satscores sc    WHERE sc.NumGE1500 = (SELECT MAX(NumGE1500) FROM satscores) ); 
<think> Alright, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "What is the complete address of the school with the lowest excellence rate? Indicate the Street, City, Zip and State."   First, let's break down what the user is asking for. They want the complete address, which includes Street, City, Zip, and State. The key here is to find the school with the lowest excellence rate. From the extra knowledge provided, I know that the excellence rate is calculated as NumGE1500 divided by NumTstTakr, both of which are fields in the satscores table.  So, my first thought is to look at the satscores table because it contains the necessary data for calculating the excellence rate. The formula would be ExcellenceRate = NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr. However, I should also consider cases where NumTstTakr might be zero to avoid division by zero errors. But since this is a school's test scores, it's likely that NumTstTakr won't be zero if there are any test takers.  Next, I need to find the school with the lowest excellence rate. To do this, I can calculate the excellence rate for each school and then order them from lowest to highest. The school at the top of this ordered list would have the lowest rate.  But wait, the schools table contains the address information—Street, City, Zip, and State. So, I need to join the satscores table with the schools table on their common key. Looking at the schemas, both tables have a CDSCode field which is the primary key in schools and cds in satscores. So, I should use this to link them.  I'll probably use an INNER JOIN or perhaps a LEFT JOIN depending on whether all schools in satscores exist in schools. Since it's likely that every school in satscores is also in schools, an INNER JOIN should suffice.  Now, putting it together: I need to select the address fields from the schools table but only for the school with the minimum excellence rate. To do this efficiently, I might first calculate the excellence rates, order them, and then pick the top one.  One approach could be to use a subquery to find the minimum excellence rate and then select the school(s) that have that rate. Alternatively, I can sort all schools by their excellence rate in ascending order and take the first one.  Let me sketch this out:  1. Calculate ExcellenceRate for each school. 2. Find the minimum ExcellenceRate among them. 3. Select the school(s) with that rate. 4. Retrieve their complete address from the schools table.  But, in SQL, to get the top record based on a calculated field, I can use ORDER BY and LIMIT 1. So, perhaps the most straightforward way is to compute the excellence rate, sort by it, and pick the first entry.  So, the structure would be:  SELECT schools.Street, schools.City, schools.Zip, schools.State FROM satscores INNER JOIN schools ON satscores.cds = schools.CDSCode WHERE (satscores.NumGE1500 / satscores.NumTstTakr) =      (SELECT MIN(NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr) FROM satscores)  But wait, what if multiple schools have the same lowest rate? The user might want all of them. But since they asked for "the school," maybe just one is intended.  Alternatively, using ORDER BY and LIMIT:  SELECT schools.Street, schools.City, schools.Zip, schools.State FROM satscores INNER JOIN schools ON satscores.cds = schools.CDSCode ORDER BY (NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr) ASC LIMIT 1;  But I'm not sure if ORDER BY works directly with calculated fields without first selecting them. So perhaps I should calculate the rate in a subquery or use it in the WHERE clause as earlier.  Wait, another thought: Using the MIN function might miss cases where multiple schools have the same minimum rate. Also, using LIMIT 1 ensures we only get one school, which aligns with the question's phrasing.  Another consideration is that some schools might not have any test takers (NumTstTakr = 0), but since NumGE1500 can't be negative and if there are no test takers, perhaps their excellence rate is zero or undefined. But in reality, a school would only have an entry in satscores if they had test takers, so maybe this isn't an issue.  Let me think about the exact SQL syntax:  I need to join the two tables on cds/CDSCode. Then, for each row, compute NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr as the excellence rate. Then find the school with the minimum of that value and return its address.  Using a subquery in the WHERE clause seems appropriate. So first, calculate the minimum excellence rate across all schools, then select the school(s) where their rate equals this minimum.  But to get the minimum, I can compute it by selecting MIN(NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr) from satscores.  So, putting it together:  SELECT s.Street, s.City, s.State, s.Zip FROM schools s INNER JOIN satscores sc ON s.CDSCode = sc.cds WHERE (sc.NumGE1500 / sc.NumTstTakr) = (     SELECT MIN(NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr)     FROM satscores );  But wait, what if a school has multiple entries in satscores? Maybe not, since each entry is likely per year or something. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that each cds in satscores corresponds to one row.  Alternatively, maybe I should group by schools.CDSCode and calculate their overall excellence rate. That's a possibility if a school has multiple entries in satscores. For example, if a school has test scores from different years or different tests, we might need to aggregate NumGE1500 and NumTstTakr.  Wait, the question is about the school with the lowest excellence rate, so it depends on whether each row in satscores represents all the test takers for that school. If each row is per test instance (e.g., SAT, ACT), then we might need to sum across all instances for a school to get total NumGE1500 and total NumTstTakr.  But looking at the schema again, it's not clear how satscores are structured—whether each row represents a single test administration or aggregates. If each school has only one row in satscores, then no problem. But if they have multiple, we need to aggregate.  Assuming that each school can have multiple rows (e.g., different tests), then for each school, the excellence rate would be total NumGE1500 divided by total NumTstTakr across all their entries.  In that case, I should first group satscores by cds, summing both NumGE1500 and NumTstTakr, then calculate the excellence rate per school.  So, the query would involve grouping:  SELECT schools.Street, schools.City, schools.State, schools.Zip FROM (     SELECT cds,            SUM(NumGE1500) AS TotalGE,            SUM(NumTstTakr) AS TotalTestTakers     FROM satscores     GROUP BY cds ) sc INNER JOIN schools ON sc.cds = schools.CDSCode WHERE (sc.TotalGE / sc.TotalTestTakers) = (     SELECT MIN(TotalGE / TotalTestTakers)     FROM (         SELECT cds,                SUM(NumGE1500) AS TotalGE,                SUM(NumTstTakr) AS TotalTestTakers         FROM satscores         GROUP BY cds     ) sub );  But that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, using a Common Table Expression (CTE) might make it cleaner.  But perhaps in this case, since the question is about individual schools and their test scores, each school has only one row in satscores. So maybe I don't need to group by cds.  Alternatively, if multiple rows exist per school, then grouping is necessary. Since the problem doesn't specify, but for thoroughness, perhaps grouping would be better.  However, given time constraints, I might proceed under the assumption that each school has one row in satscores, so no aggregation is needed beyond what's already there.  Thus, the initial approach of joining schools and satscores on cds/CDSCode, calculating excellence rate as NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr for each row, then selecting the school with the minimum rate would suffice.  So, putting it all together, the SQL query would:  - Join the two tables. - Where the calculated rate equals the minimum across all schools. - Select the address fields from schools.  I think that's the correct approach. Now, let me write this without any comments as per the user's instruction. </think>  SELECT s.Street, s.City, s.State, s.Zip FROM schools s INNER JOIN satscores sc ON s.CDSCode = sc.cds WHERE (sc.NumGE1500 / sc.NumTstTakr) = (     SELECT MIN(NumGE1500 / NumTstTakr)     FROM satscores );
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for the websites of schools in Los Angeles County that have between 2,000 and 3,000 test takers.  First, I should break down the components of the question:  1. **Website Information**: This is the main data point we need to extract. It's stored in the `Website` column of the `schools` table.  2. **Los Angeles County**: The county name is specified as Los Angeles. In the database schema provided, the `County Name` is part of the `frpm` table and the `County` is also present in the `schools` table. However, since we're joining multiple tables, I'll need to check where this information is accessed from.  3. **Test Takers Count**: The number of test takers is given as between 2,000 and 3,000. Looking at the `satscores` table, there's a column called `NumTstTakr`, which represents the number of test takers. So I'll need to use this column in my WHERE clause.  Next, I should consider how these tables relate. The `frpm` and `schools` tables are connected via the `CDSCode`. The `satscores` table also references this `cds` as a foreign key. Therefore, I can join all three tables using their respective keys.  Here's the step-by-step plan:  - **Join the Tables**: Since both `frpm` and `satscores` reference the `CDSCode`, I'll join `frpm` with `schools` on `CDSCode`, and then join `satscores` with them as well. This ensures that all necessary data points are accessible in one query.  - **Filter by County**: In the `frpm` table, the `County Name` is 'Los Angeles'. So I'll add a condition to filter where `County Name` equals 'Los Angeles'.  - **Set Range for Test Takers**: The `NumTstTakr` should be between 2,000 and 3,000. I'll use a WHERE clause with `BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000` on the `NumTstTakr` column from `satscores`.  - **Retrieve Website**: Finally, select the `Website` column from the `schools` table.  Potential issues to consider:  - **Data Types**: Ensure that `NumTstTakr` is an integer, which it is according to the schema. So using numerical values in the WHERE clause should be fine.  - **Joins and Aliases**: Since all tables are connected via `CDSCode`, I can use INNER JOINs without issues. Using aliases might make the query cleaner but isn't necessary unless needed for clarity.  Putting it all together, the SQL query will join the three tables on their respective keys, filter by Los Angeles County, set the test taker range, and return the website URLs. </think>  SELECT T2.Website FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode INNER JOIN satscores AS T3 ON T1.CDSCode = T3.cds WHERE T1.`County Name` = 'Los Angeles' AND T3.NumTstTakr BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "What is the average number of test takers from Fresno schools that opened between 1/1/1980 and 12/31/1980?"   Let me break this down step by step.  First, I know that the data is spread across three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The question is about Fresno schools, so I should probably start with the schools table to get information about which schools are in Fresno and when they opened.  Looking at the schools table, the 'County' field likely indicates the county name. Since we're interested in Fresno schools, I need to filter where County = 'Fresno'.   Next, the question specifies schools that opened between 1/1/1980 and 12/31/1980. The schools table has an 'OpenDate' field of type DATE. So, I can use a WHERE clause to select records where OpenDate is within that range.  Now, for each school that meets these criteria, I need to find the number of test takers. Test taker data is in the satscores table under 'NumTstTakr'. Each entry in satscores has a 'cds' field which is the primary key and also a foreign key referencing the schools' CDSCode.  So, I'll need to join the schools table with the satscores table on their respective keys. Since both have CDSCode/cds as identifiers, I can use an INNER JOIN or just specify the join condition in the FROM clause with a comma, which is acceptable in SQL for simple joins.  Once joined, I can aggregate the data by school (using GROUP BY) to calculate the average number of test takers per school. The AVG() function will help here, applied to 'NumTstTakr'.  Putting it all together:  1. Select from both schools and satscores tables. 2. Join on CDSCode = cds. 3. Filter for County = 'Fresno' and OpenDate in 1980. 4. Group by school name or some identifier, but since each row is per school, maybe just group by the school's name to get one average per school. 5. Compute the average of NumTstTakr.  Wait, actually, each school might have multiple entries in satscores for different years or types (rtype), so if I want the total test takers across all such entries for a single school in 1980, I should sum them and then take an average? Or maybe just average directly. Hmm, but the question says "average number of test takers," which suggests per school.  So the final SQL would involve selecting s.NumTstTakr, joining schools and satscores on CDSCode/cds, filtering county = 'Fresno' and opendate in 1980, group by school name or cdscode, and then average s.NumTstTakr.   Wait, but if I just want the average across all qualifying schools, maybe I don't need to group by each school. Let me think: The question is asking for the average number of test takers per school that opened in 1980 in Fresno. So, yes, I should calculate the average per school and then take an overall average.  Wait no, actually, perhaps it's simpler: Each school has one entry (if they have data), so AVG(s.NumTstTakr) across all such schools would give the average number of test takers per school in that group. Alternatively, sum all test takers and divide by the number of schools, but SQL can handle it with the AVG function.  So the final query should be:  SELECT AVG(s.NumTstTakr) FROM schools s JOIN satscores sa ON s.CDSCode = sa.cds WHERE s.County = 'Fresno' AND s.OpenDate BETWEEN '1980-01-01' AND '1980-12-31';  Wait, but I'm using FROM with two tables. Wait no, in the query above, it's better to specify both tables and join them properly.  Actually, in SQL, you can list multiple tables in the FROM clause and specify the join condition, like:  SELECT AVG(sa.NumTstTakr) FROM schools s, satscores sa WHERE s.CDSCode = sa.cds   AND s.County = 'Fresno'   AND s.OpenDate BETWEEN '1980-01-01' AND '1980-12-31';  This way, it's an inner join based on the condition. So I think this should work.  I also need to make sure that the dates are correctly formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The OpenDate is a DATE type, so using '1980-01-01' and '1980-12-31' should be correct.  So, putting it all together without any comments, the SQL query would select the average of NumTstTakr from satscores where the school is in Fresno and opened in 1980. </think>  SELECT AVG(sa.NumTstTakr) FROM schools s, satscores sa WHERE s.CDSCode = sa.cds AND s.County = 'Fresno' AND s.OpenDate BETWEEN '1980-01-01' AND '1980-12-31';
SELECT s.Phone FROM schools s JOIN satscores sa ON s.CDSCode = sa.cds WHERE s.District = 'Fresno Unified' AND sa.AvgScrRead IS NOT NULL ORDER BY sa.AvgScrRead ASC LIMIT 1; 
SELECT      s.School AS SchoolName,     s.County AS CountyName,     ss.AvgScrRead AS AverageReadingScore FROM (     SELECT          s.CDSCode,         s.School,         s.County,         ss.AvgScrRead,         RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.County ORDER BY ss.AvgScrRead DESC) AS RankWithinCounty     FROM schools s     JOIN satscores ss ON s.CDSCode = ss.cds     WHERE s.Virtual = 'F' AND ss.AvgScrRead IS NOT NULL ) AS Subquery WHERE RankWithinCounty <= 5; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "What is the type of education offered in the school who scored the highest average in Math?"   First, let me break down what's being asked here. The user wants to know the educational option type (I think that's what they mean by 'type of education offered') of the school that has the highest average math score.  Looking at the database schema provided, there are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools.   The satscores table seems relevant because it contains columns related to SAT scores, including AvgScrMath which is the average math score. So I'll probably need to use this table to find the highest average.  But wait, the question also asks about the educational option type of that school. The frpm table has a column called 'Educational Option Type', so I think I'll have to join these two tables somehow.   The schools table has other information about the schools, but since we're focusing on SAT scores and educational type, maybe it's not directly needed unless there's a need for more joins.  Now, the satscores table has 'cds' as its primary key, which is the CDSCode. The frpm table also uses CDSCode as its primary key. So I can join these two tables on their CDSCode columns.  The plan is to:  1. Find the school with the highest average math score from satscores. 2. Get that school's CDSCode. 3. Use that CDSCode to find the Educational Option Type in frpm. 4. Return that type.  But wait, how do I get the maximum value? I think using MAX(AvgScrMath) would give me the highest average score. Once I have that score, I can then find which school(s) have that score and extract their educational option type.  Wait, but sometimes there might be multiple schools with the same highest score. The question says "the school", implying a singular answer, so maybe we just take any one of them or perhaps the first one. But for now, let's assume there's only one.  So, step by step:  - In satscores, find the maximum AvgScrMath. - Then select all rows where AvgScrMath equals that max value. - For each of those rows, get their cds (CDSCode). - Join with frpm on CDSCode to get Educational Option Type. - Finally, return the Educational Option Type.  But how do I write this in SQL? Maybe a subquery. Let's see:  First, select the maximum AvgScrMath from satscores. Then, select all rows where AvgScrMath equals that max. From those, get their cds codes. Then join with frpm on CDSCode to get Educational Option Type.  Alternatively, I can write it in one query using a subquery to find the max and then filter by that value.  Wait, but if there are multiple schools with the same highest score, this would return all of them. But perhaps the user expects just one answer, so maybe we need to limit it or take any.  Now, putting it together:  SELECT T1.`Educational Option Type` FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN satscores AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.cds WHERE T2.AvgScrMath = (SELECT MAX(AvgScrMath) FROM satscores);  Wait, but some AvgScrMath could be NULL. I need to make sure that the subquery doesn't return NULL. Maybe add a check for non-NULL values.  Alternatively, in the satscores table, if all AvgScrMath are NULL, then this would cause an issue. So perhaps the subquery should exclude NULLs or handle them appropriately.  Wait, looking at the schema, AvgScrMath is INTEGER and can be NULL. So when calculating MAX(AvgScrMath), it will ignore NULLs. But what if all are NULL? Then the max would be NULL, which might cause no rows to return. So maybe I should ensure that we're only considering non-NULL values.  So perhaps in the subquery, select MAX(AvgScrMath) where AvgScrMath is not NULL.  Wait, but the query will still work because if all are NULL, then the subquery returns NULL, and the WHERE clause would be T2.AvgScrMath = NULL, which doesn't match anything since you can't compare with NULL using '='. So to avoid that, perhaps we should handle it by ensuring there's at least one non-NULL value.  But maybe in this case, the data has at least one school with a valid AvgScrMath score. So I'll proceed under that assumption.  So, the SQL would be:  SELECT T1.`Educational Option Type`  FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN satscores AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.cds WHERE T2.AvgScrMath = (SELECT MAX(AvgScrMath) FROM satscores);  Wait, but if there are multiple schools with the same highest AvgScrMath, this would return all of their Educational Option Types. So maybe we should add a LIMIT 1 to get just one.  Alternatively, perhaps it's better to first find the max score, then find the school(s) that have that score, and pick any one (maybe the first).  So adding a LIMIT at the end:  SELECT T1.`Educational Option Type`  FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN satscores AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.cds WHERE T2.AvgScrMath = (SELECT MAX(AvgScrMath) FROM satscores) LIMIT 1;  But wait, the question is about the type of education offered by the school with the highest average. It's possible that multiple schools have the same max score but different educational types. But perhaps the user expects all such types or any one.  Alternatively, maybe we should group them and get a list, but the question seems to ask for the type, so probably just one value is expected.  Thus, I think the SQL with LIMIT 1 would suffice. </think>  SELECT T1.`Educational Option Type` FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN satscores AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.cds WHERE T2.AvgScrMath = (SELECT MAX(AvgScrMath) FROM satscores) LIMIT 1;

SELECT s.MailStreet, s.School  FROM schools s  INNER JOIN satscores sa ON s.CDSCode = sa.cds  WHERE sa.AvgScrRead IS NOT NULL  ORDER BY sa.AvgScrRead ASC  LIMIT 1; 
<think> Okay, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query that answers the question: "What is the total number of schools whose total SAT scores are greater or equal to 1500 whose mailing city is Lakeport?"   First, let's break down the problem. The user wants the count of schools where two conditions are met. The first condition is about the SAT scores being at least 1500, and the second is that the school's mailing city is Lakeport.  I know that there are three tables involved: frpm, satscores, and schools. Each has a CDSCode as the primary key, which means I can join them using this code.  The total SAT score isn't directly provided in the satscores table; it's computed by adding AvgScrRead, AvgScrMath, and AvgScrWrite. So, I'll need to calculate that sum in the query. Also, there's a NumGE1500 field which might represent the number of students scoring 1500 or above, but the question is about the total score being >=1500, not the count of students. So, maybe I should focus on calculating the average scores instead.  Wait, no—AvgScrRead, AvgScrMath, and AvgScrWrite are averages per subject. To get the total SAT score, each student's total would be the sum of these three. But since we have the average for each school, adding them would give the average total per student. However, the question is about whether the school's total SAT scores (perhaps in aggregate) meet or exceed 1500. Hmm, that part might need clarification.  Wait, perhaps it's considering each student's total score being >=1500, but the user says "total SAT scores are greater or equal to 1500." Alternatively, they might be referring to the sum of all students' scores across the three sections. But I think the more logical approach is that for a school, if the average total (sum of AvgScrRead + AvgScrMath + AvgScrWrite) is >=1500, then it meets the condition.  So, the steps are:  1. Join the satscores and schools tables on CDSCode because we need data from both. 2. Filter where the mailing city in schools is 'Lakeport'. 3. Calculate the total SAT score per school by adding AvgScrRead + AvgScrMath + AvgScrWrite. 4. Ensure that this sum is >=1500. 5. Count how many such schools exist.  Wait, but looking at the satscores table, there's a field called NumGE1500 which counts the number of test takers with scores >=1500. Maybe that can be used instead of calculating the averages. But the question isn't about the count of students; it's about whether the school's total SAT score meets or exceeds 1500.  Alternatively, perhaps each student's SAT score is the sum of their reading, math, and writing scores, so a school's total would be the sum across all students. But that might not make sense because schools can have varying numbers of students. The question isn't clear on whether it wants per-student average or total.  Wait, the user provided extra knowledge: "Total SAT scores can be computed by AvgScrRead + AvgScrMath + AvgScrWrite." So they want the sum of these three averages to be >=1500.  But wait, the SAT is scored out of 2400 in total (each section up to 800). So a total score per student would range from 600 to 2400. Therefore, for a school's average total SAT score, we calculate AvgScrRead + AvgScrMath + AvgScrWrite and see if that sum is >=1500.  So the condition is:  AvgScrRead + AvgScrMath + AvgScrWrite >= 1500  Now, I need to join satscores with schools because satscores contains the SAT data, and schools contain the mailing city info. So I'll use an INNER JOIN on CDSCode.  Then, I'll select from these joined tables where MailCity is 'Lakeport' and the sum of the three AvgScr fields is >=1500. Finally, count the distinct schools to avoid counting duplicates if a school appears multiple times in satscores for different years or rtypes.  Wait, but satscores has 'rtype', which I think stands for report type, maybe different years or categories. So each CDSCode might have multiple entries. If we want each school counted once regardless of how many times they appear in satscores, we should use COUNT(DISTINCT s.CDSCode).  Putting it all together:  - Join satscores and schools on CDSCode. - Filter where MailCity is 'Lakeport'. - Compute the sum of the three AvgScr fields >=1500. - Count the number of distinct schools meeting these conditions.  So the SQL would look something like this:  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.CDSCode)  FROM satscores sa INNER JOIN schools s ON sa.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE s.MailCity = 'Lakeport' AND (sa.AvgScrRead + sa.AvgScrMath + sa.AvgScrWrite) >= 1500;  I think that's the correct approach. It ensures we're only counting each school once, even if they have multiple entries in satscores. </think>  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.CDSCode) FROM satscores sa INNER JOIN schools s ON sa.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE s.MailCity = 'Lakeport' AND (sa.AvgScrRead + sa.AvgScrMath + sa.AvgScrWrite) >= 1500;
SELECT      s.SchoolName,     SUM(sa.NumTstTakr) AS TotalTestTakers FROM      schools s INNER JOIN      satscores sa ON s.CDSCode = sa.cds WHERE      s.MailCity = 'Fresno' GROUP BY      s.School; 
SELECT School, MailZip FROM schools WHERE (AdmFName1 = 'Avetik' AND AdmLName1 = 'Atoian') OR (AdmFName2 = 'Avetik' AND AdmLName2 = 'Atoian') OR (AdmFName3 = 'Avetik' AND AdmLName3 = 'Atoian'); 
SELECT    COUNT(CASE WHEN County = 'Colusa' AND MailState = 'CA' THEN CDSCode ELSE NULL END) /    COUNT(CASE WHEN County = 'Humboldt' AND MailState = 'CA' THEN CDSCode ELSE NULL END) AS Ratio FROM schools; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query to answer the question: "Of all the schools with a mailing state address in California, how many are active in San Joaquin city?" Let me break this down step by step.  First, I'll look at the database schema provided. There's a table called 'schools' which has several columns. The relevant columns here seem to be:  - StatusType: This probably indicates whether the school is active or not. - MailState: This would tell us the state where the school's mail address is located. - City: This should indicate the city where the school is located.  The question specifies two main criteria: 1. Schools must have a mailing state of California, so MailState = 'CA'. 2. The schools must be active in San Joaquin city. So, I think this means the StatusType is 'Active' and the City is 'San Joaquin'.  Wait, but looking at the schema again, the 'City' column might not necessarily refer to the mailing address's city. There's a 'MailCity' column as well. Hmm, but in the schools table, there are columns like City, MailStreet, MailStrAbr, etc. So I think for the mailing state, we use MailState, but for the physical location, it's just City.  But the question is about schools where their mailing address is in California and they're active in San Joaquin city. So perhaps 'City' refers to where they are located physically, so that should be 'San Joaquin'.  So the conditions would be: - MailState = 'CA' - StatusType = 'Active' - City = 'San Joaquin'  I need to count how many schools meet these criteria.  Now, considering SQL syntax. I'll select from the 'schools' table where these three conditions are met and then count the number of rows.  So the SQL query would be:  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE StatusType = 'Active' AND MailState = 'CA' AND City = 'San Joaquin';  I should make sure that the column names match exactly as in the schema. For example, 'StatusType', 'MailState', and 'City' are all correct.  Wait, does San Joaquin have any case sensitivity issues? Probably not, but just to be safe, I'll use it exactly as given.  Also, since we're counting, using COUNT(*) is appropriate here. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE StatusType = 'Active' AND MailState = 'CA' AND City = 'San Joaquin';
SELECT Phone, Ext FROM (     SELECT s.Phone, s.Ext, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY sc.AvgScrWrite DESC) AS RowNum     FROM schools s     JOIN satscores sc ON s.CDSCode = sc.cds ) WHERE RowNum = 333; 
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for.  The question is: "What is the phone number and extension number for the school with the zip code 95203-3704? Indicate the school's name."   Alright, so I need to extract three pieces of information: Phone number, extension, and school name. The condition here is that the school has a specific zip code, which is 95203-3704.  Now, looking at the database schema provided, there are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. Since we're dealing with phone numbers and zip codes, I should check where those fields are located.   In the 'schools' table, I see columns like Phone (under the 'Phone' field) and Ext (probably short for Extension). The zip code is stored in the 'Zip' column of the same table. Also, the school name is in the 'School' column.  So, the query needs to select these three fields: Phone, Ext, and School from the schools table where Zip equals '95203-3704'.  I should make sure that the WHERE clause correctly filters for the exact zip code provided. Since SQL might be case-sensitive depending on the database, I need to ensure the value is exactly as stored. Also, since it's a string, it needs to be enclosed in quotes.  Putting it all together, the SQL query will select Phone, Ext, and School from schools where Zip is '95203-3704'.   I don't think any JOINs are necessary here because all required fields are in the same table. So, the query should be straightforward. </think>  SELECT `Phone`, `Ext`, `School` FROM `schools` WHERE `Zip` = '95203-3704'
SELECT `Website` FROM `schools` WHERE (`AdmFName1` = 'Mike' AND `AdmLName1` = 'Larson')    OR (`AdmFName2` = 'Mike' AND `AdmLName2` = 'Larson')    OR (`AdmFName3` = 'Mike' AND `AdmLName3` = 'Larson')    OR (`AdmFName1` = 'Dante' AND `AdmLName1` = 'Alvarez')    OR (`AdmFName2` = 'Dante' AND `AdmLName2` = 'Alvarez')    OR (`AdmFName3` = 'Dante' AND `AdmLName3` = 'Alvarez'); 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for the websites of all partially virtual chartered schools located in San Joaquin.  First, let me understand the database schema provided. There are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. From the context, it seems the relevant information needed here is in the 'schools' table because it contains fields like 'Website', 'Charter', 'Virtual', and 'County'.  The user mentioned that "partially virtual" corresponds to Virtual = 'P'. So I need to filter where Virtual equals 'P'. Also, they referred to Charter schools as having Charter = 1 in the schools table. Therefore, I should include a condition where Charter is 1.  Additionally, the schools must be located in San Joaquin County. Looking at the schools table, there's a field named 'County', so I can use that to filter by 'San Joaquin'.  The goal is to retrieve the websites of these schools, which means selecting the 'Website' column from the schools table.  Putting it all together, I need to select Website from schools where: - Virtual = 'P' - Charter = 1 - County = 'San Joaquin'  I should structure this into a SELECT statement with the appropriate WHERE conditions. Also, since the user wants only the SQL without comments, I'll make sure not to include any extra explanations in the query.  So, the final SQL query would select the Website from schools where all three conditions are met. </think>  SELECT `Website` FROM `schools` WHERE `Virtual` = 'P' AND `Charter` = 1 AND `County` = 'San Joaquin';
SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM schools  WHERE City = 'Hickman' AND Charter = 1 AND DOC = '52'; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM frpm JOIN schools ON frpm.CDSCode = schools.CDSCode WHERE schools.Charter = 0 AND frpm.`County Name` = 'Los Angeles' AND `Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)` < 0.18; 
<think> Alright, let's break down how I approached solving this SQL query problem.  First, I read the user's question carefully. They want the names of all administrators in chartered schools with a specific charter number, 00D2. Additionally, they need the school name and the city associated with each school.  I started by identifying the relevant tables. The 'schools' table contains information about each school, including whether it's chartered (Charter column), the charter number (CharterNum), the school name (School), and the city (City). It also has administrator details like first and last names and emails for up to three administrators.  Since the question is about chartered schools, I knew I needed to filter where Charter = 1 and CharterNum = '00D2'.   Next, I considered how to get all administrators. Each administrator has a first name (AdmFName1, AdmFName2, AdmFName3) and last name (AdmLName1, etc.) for up to three admins per school. I decided to concatenate these into full names using the || operator in SQL.  I structured the SELECT statement to include the school's name, city, and each administrator's full name. Each admin's first and last names are concatenated, so Admin1 would be AdmFName1 || ' ' || AdmLName1, and similarly for Admin2 and Admin3.  I made sure to use DISTINCT to avoid duplicate entries, especially if a school has multiple admins but the same details might repeat across rows.   The FROM clause specifies the 'schools' table since that's where all needed data resides. The WHERE clause applies the necessary filters: Charter must be 1 (chartered) and CharterNum equals '00D2'.  I double-checked to ensure I didn't miss any columns, especially since some fields like AdmFName3 or AdmLName3 might be NULL if a school has fewer than three admins. But including them as separate columns ensures all possible admins are listed.  Finally, I formatted the SQL without comments, as per the user's request, making sure it's clean and correctly structured. </think>  SELECT DISTINCT School, City, AdmFName1 || ' ' || AdmLName1 AS Admin1, AdmFName2 || ' ' || AdmLName2 AS Admin2, AdmFName3 || ' ' || AdmLName3 AS Admin3 FROM schools WHERE Charter = 1 AND CharterNum = '00D2'
<think> Alright, let's tackle this SQL problem step by step. The user is asking for the total number of schools that have a mailing city in Hickman and belong to charter number 00D4.   First, I need to identify which table contains the necessary information. Looking at the provided database schema, the `schools` table has columns like `MailCity`, `CharterNum`, and others related to school details.  Next, I should consider the conditions: 1. Mailing city is Hickman: This translates to `MailCity = 'Hickman'`. 2. Charter number is 00D4: So, `CharterNum = '00D4'`.  I need to count the number of rows in the `schools` table that meet both these conditions. Using the `COUNT(*)` function makes sense here because it counts all rows that satisfy the WHERE clause.  Putting it all together, I'll write a SELECT statement with COUNT(*), specify the table as `schools`, and set up the WHERE clause with both conditions combined using AND to ensure both are met.  I should also make sure that the column names match exactly what's in the table. For instance, `MailCity` is the correct column name for mailing city, and `CharterNum` holds the charter numbers.  So, the final SQL query will select the count of all records where MailCity is 'Hickman' and CharterNum is '00D4'. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE MailCity = 'Hickman' AND CharterNum = '00D4';
SELECT      (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE County = 'Santa Clara' AND FundingType = 'Local') /      (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE County = 'Santa Clara' AND FundingType IS NOT NULL) * 100; 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools  WHERE FundingType = 'Directly Funded'  AND County = 'Stanislaus'  AND OpenDate BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2005-12-31'; 
<think> Alright, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for the total number of Community College District closures in San Francisco in 1989.  First, I'll look at the database schema provided. There are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The relevant information here seems to be in the schools table because it contains details about when a school was closed, which is stored in the ClosedDate column.  I need to extract data where the city is San Francisco. In the schools table, there's a 'City' field that I can use for this condition. Also, since we're looking specifically at Community College Districts, I should filter by the district type. However, checking the schema, I don't see a direct column indicating it's a community college. But considering typical structures, maybe the 'District Name' or another field could help. Alternatively, perhaps knowing that community colleges might have specific names or codes.  Wait, actually, in the schools table, there's a 'StatusType', but that might not directly indicate it's a community college. Maybe I need to look elsewhere. Wait, perhaps the 'School Type' in the frpm table could help, but since the ClosureDate is only in the schools table, maybe I should focus there.  Hmm, perhaps for this question, we can assume that Community College Districts are a specific type of district. So, maybe the 'District Name' includes "Community". Alternatively, if not, maybe it's based on some code or another field. But without explicit data, I might have to make an assumption here.  Wait, the user provided extra knowledge earlier, but in this case, perhaps the key is that the school is a community college district. So, perhaps looking for 'Community College' in the name or type.  But since the database schema doesn't explicitly have a column indicating whether it's a community college, I might need to infer based on other fields. Alternatively, maybe the 'District Name' includes "Community College District" as part of its naming convention.  So, perhaps I can filter where the District Name includes such terms. But without knowing the exact data, this could be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps there's another way, but given the info provided, let me proceed with what I have.  So, to get the count of closures in 1989 in San Francisco, I need to:  1. Filter schools where City = 'San Francisco'. 2. Check if they are Community College Districts. Maybe by checking if the District Name includes "Community College". 3. Extract ClosedDate and ensure it's within the year 1989. 4. Count how many such entries exist.  Wait, but looking at the schools table, the 'ClosedDate' is a DATE type. So I can use a WHERE clause to check if YEAR(ClosedDate) = 1989.  Also, since we're dealing with districts, perhaps we should group by district or ensure that each closure represents a unique district closure. But the question asks for the total amount of closures, so maybe it's just a count of rows meeting the criteria.  Putting this together, the SQL query would select from the schools table where:  - City is 'San Francisco' - District Name includes "Community College" (assuming that's how they are named) - ClosedDate falls within 1989  So I'll write something like SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE City = 'San Francisco' AND District LIKE '%Community%College%' AND STRFTIME('%Y', ClosedDate) = '1989';  Wait, but in SQL, the exact date functions can vary. For SQLite, it's strftime('%Y', ClosedDate). Also, to count each district closure once, perhaps we should use COUNT(DISTINCT District), but maybe just COUNT(*) is sufficient if each row represents a school.  But considering that each CDSCode is unique per school, so each closure would be one row. So using COUNT(*) is correct.  Wait, but the question is about Community College Districts, which are districts, not schools. Each district may have multiple schools. So perhaps I should group by District and count how many districts closed in that year. Hmm, that complicates it a bit because each school closure doesn't necessarily mean the entire district closed.  Alternatively, maybe the user considers each school closure as part of the district's closure. But without more context, it's hard to say. Given the schema, perhaps each row is per school, so if multiple schools in the same district closed in 1989, each would count individually. But the question asks for the total amount of Community College District closures, which implies per district.  Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check: The user's question is about the number of closures, not the number of districts. So maybe it's just a count of schools in San Francisco that are community colleges and closed in 1989.  Alternatively, if each closure is at the district level, then multiple schools could be part of one district closure, but without data on that, perhaps it's better to proceed with school-level counts.  So, the SQL query would be:  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools  WHERE City = 'San Francisco'  AND District LIKE '%Community College%'  AND STRFTIME('%Y', ClosedDate) = '1989';  But I'm not sure if District Name includes "Community College" exactly. Maybe it's better to use a more general approach, perhaps using LIKE with wildcards.  Alternatively, maybe Community Colleges have a specific StatusType or another field. But without that info, I have to make an assumption.  So, the final SQL is as above. </think>  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools WHERE City = 'San Francisco' AND District LIKE '%Community%College%' AND strftime('%Y', ClosedDate) = '1989';
SELECT County, COUNT(ClosedDate) AS ClosureCount  FROM schools  WHERE SOC = '11' AND ClosedDate BETWEEN '1980-01-01' AND '1989-12-31' GROUP BY County ORDER BY ClosureCount DESC; 
<think> Alright, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me break down what they're asking for.  First, the user wants the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) school district identification number for all schools that have a School Ownership Code (SOC) and are part of State Special Schools. From the extra knowledge provided, I know that State Special Schools correspond to SOC = 31.  Looking at the database schema, the relevant table here is `schools` because it contains both the NCES district ID (`NCESDist`) and the SOC fields (`SOC` and `SOCType`). The other tables, `frpm` and `satscores`, don't seem directly related to this query since they focus on meal programs and test scores respectively.  I need to select the `NCESDist` from the `schools` table where two conditions are met: SOC is not null (since the school has a School Ownership Code) and SOCType equals 31, which indicates State Special Schools.   So, the SQL query will be a SELECT statement targeting `NCESDist`, with a WHERE clause that checks both conditions. I should make sure to handle cases where SOC might be null by explicitly checking that it's not null.  Putting it all together, the query selects `NCESDist` from `schools` where `SOC` is not null and `SOCType` equals '31'. </think>  SELECT NCESDist FROM schools WHERE SOC IS NOT NULL AND SOCType = 31
SELECT s.StatusType, COUNT(*)  FROM frpm f INNER JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE f.`County Name` = 'Alpine' AND f.`School Type` = 'District Community Day' GROUP BY s.StatusType; 
SELECT T1.`District Code` FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode WHERE T2.Magnet = 0 AND T2.City = 'Fresno'; 
SELECT frpm.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` FROM frpm JOIN schools ON frpm.CDSCode = schools.CDSCode WHERE schools.EdOpsCode = 'SSS'   AND schools.County = 'Fremont'   AND frpm.`Academic Year` = '2014-2015'; 
SELECT f.`Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` FROM frpm f JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE s.School = 'Youth Authority School' AND s.MailStreet = 'PO Box 1040'; 
<think> Alright, so I've got this SQL problem to solve. The user wants me to find the lowest grade for a specific school. Let's break it down step by step.  First, understanding the question: "What is the lowest grade for the District Special Education Consortia School with NCES district ID 0613360?" From the extra knowledge, I know that 'District Special Education Consortia School' corresponds to EdOpsCode = 'SPECON'.  Looking at the database schema, there are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The relevant info is in the schools table because it contains the NCESDist (which I assume is the NCES district ID) and EdOpsCode.  So, my goal is to query the 'Low Grade' from the frpm table where the school meets two conditions: NCESDist is 0613360 and EdOpsCode is SPECON. But wait, how do these tables link? The schools table's primary key is CDSCode, which is also in frpm as a foreign key. So I'll need to join schools and frpm on CDSCode.  I should select 'Low Grade' from frpm where the corresponding record in schools has NCESDist = 0613360 and EdOpsCode = 'SPECON'.   Putting it together, I'll write an INNER JOIN between schools and frpm ON their CDSCodes. Then apply the WHERE conditions for NCESDist and EdOpsCode. That should give me the correct row, from which I can extract the Low Grade.  I need to make sure the SQL syntax is correct: using quotes around string literals and ensuring case sensitivity matches if necessary. </think>  SELECT `Low Grade` FROM frpm INNER JOIN schools ON frpm.CDSCode = schools.CDSCode WHERE schools.NCESDist = '0613360' AND schools.EdOpsCode = 'SPECON';
<think> Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for the educational level name of schools that have Breakfast Provision 2 in county code 37, and also to indicate the school names.  First, looking at the database schema provided. There are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. Each has different columns.  The user's question mentions "Breakfast Provision 2". I'm not seeing a column that directly says "Breakfast Provision", but in the frpm table, there's a column called "NSLP Provision Status". Maybe this refers to the National School Lunch Program provision status. If Breakfast Provision 2 is related to NSLP, perhaps '2' in this context indicates a specific provision status.  Next, county code 37. In the schools table, there's a column named "County" which is a TEXT type, but wait, looking back at frpm, there's also "County Code". So maybe I need to use the County Code from frpm where it equals '37'.  The question asks for the educational level name and the school names. The schools table has a column called "EdOpsName" which might represent the educational option type as a name. Alternatively, in frpm, there's an "Educational Option Type" column. But since we need the name, perhaps "EdOpsName" from schools is more appropriate.  So I think I should join these tables to get both the school names and their educational level names. The common key between frpm and schools is CDSCode, so I'll use that to join them.  Putting it together: I need to select the School Name (from frpm) and EdOpsName (from schools). The conditions are that NSLP Provision Status in frpm is '2' and County Code is '37'. So the WHERE clause will filter on these two conditions, and then INNER JOIN the frpm and schools tables on CDSCode.  I should make sure to only include rows where both conditions are met. Also, since the user didn't specify any ordering or limits, I don't need to add those unless necessary.  So the SQL would select School Name and EdOpsName from frpm inner joined with schools on CDSCode, where NSLP Provision Status is 2 and County Code is 37. </think>  SELECT T1.`School Name`, T2.`EdOpsName` FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode WHERE T1.`NSLP Provision Status` = '2' AND T1.`County Code` = '37';
<think> Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the SQL query for the given question.  First, understanding the user's question is crucial. They're asking for the city location of a high school in Merced County that has specific grade levels and lunch provision status. The key points are:  1. **High School**: Indicated by EILCode = 'HS'. 2. **Lunch Provision 2**: This translates to NSLPProvisionStatus = 2. 3. **Grade Levels**: Low Grade is 9, High Grade is 12. 4. **County**: Merced, so County Name should be 'Merced'.  Next, I need to identify which table holds the necessary information. The `frpm` table contains details about lunch provisions (NSLPProvisionStatus) and grade levels (Low Grade, High Grade). It also has County Name.  Since the question is about a high school, I check if EILCode is in the `frpm` table. Looking at the schema, EILCode isn't directly in `frpm`, but it's present in `schools`. However, since the user provided extra knowledge that EILCode = 'HS' represents high schools, and considering the foreign keys, I can join `frpm` with `schools` using CDSCode.  Wait, actually, upon closer inspection, the `frpm` table doesn't have EILCode. So to filter for high schools, I need to join `frpm` with `schools` on CDSCode and then apply the EILCode condition from the `schools` table.  So the steps are:  - Join `frpm` and `schools` on CDSCode. - Filter where:   - County Name is 'Merced'.   - Low Grade = '9'.   - High Grade = '12'.   - NSLPProvisionStatus = 2.   - EILCode = 'HS'.  The desired output is the city location, which comes from the `City` field in `schools`.  Putting it all together, I write an INNER JOIN between the two tables and apply all the WHERE conditions. Finally, select the City from `schools`. </think>  SELECT T2.City FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode WHERE T1.CountyName = 'Merced' AND T1.LowGrade = '9' AND T1.HighGrade = '12' AND T1.NSLPProvisionStatus = 2 AND T2.EILCode = 'HS'
SELECT s.SchoolName,         ROUND(100 * f.`FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)` / f.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`, 2) AS PercentEligibleFRPM FROM frpm f JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode WHERE f.`Low Grade` = 'K'   AND f.`High Grade` = '09'   AND f.`County Name` = 'Los Angeles'; 
SELECT Low_Grade, High_Grade, COUNT(*) as CountOfGradeSpan FROM frpm JOIN schools ON frpm.CDSCode = schools.CDSCode WHERE schools.City = 'Adelanto' GROUP BY Low_Grade, High_Grade ORDER BY CountOfGradeSpan DESC; 
SELECT County, COUNT(*) as num_virtual_schools  FROM schools  WHERE Virtual = 'F' AND (County = 'San Diego' OR County = 'Santa Barbara')  GROUP BY County; 
SELECT f.`School Type`, s.School, s.Latitude  FROM frpm f  INNER JOIN schools s  ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode  ORDER BY s.Latitude DESC  LIMIT 1; 
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. Let me break down what they're asking for.  The user wants to find the city where a school in California has the lowest latitude. They also want the school's name and its lowest grade. So, first, I should identify which tables contain the necessary information.  Looking at the database schema, there are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. The 'schools' table seems to have the location details like city and state, as well as latitude. It also has a field for 'Low Grade', which is what we need. The other tables don't seem relevant here since they focus on meal programs and test scores.  So, I'll focus on the 'schools' table. My goal is to find the school in California (state = 'CA') with the minimum latitude. Once I have that record, I can extract the city, school name, and low grade.  I should use a SELECT statement with the MIN function on Latitude where State is 'CA'. But since I also need other fields like City, School, and Low Grade, I'll select those as well. To get just one row (the school with the lowest latitude), I'll limit the results to 1.  Wait, I should check if all these columns are available in the schools table. Latitude is there as a REAL, City as TEXT, School name under 'School', and Low Grade—actually, looking again, I don't see a 'Low Grade' field in the schools table. Oh no, that's a problem.  Wait, maybe it's in another table? Let me check the frpm table. Yes, there's a 'Low Grade' column in frpm. So I'll need to join the schools and frpm tables on CDSCode since both have that as a primary key.  So now my query needs to join schools and frpm where State is 'CA'. Then find the minimum latitude from that joined set. Select City, School Name, and Low Grade.  I think using an INNER JOIN would work here because I only want rows where both tables have matching CDSCode records.  Putting it all together: select City, School, LowGrade from schools inner join frpm on CDSCode where State is 'CA', order by Latitude ascending to get the lowest one first, and limit to 1 result.  I should make sure that the columns are correctly named. In schools, the school name is under 'School' column, and in frpm, it's 'Low Grade'. So I'll alias them appropriately for clarity.  Hmm, wait, do I need any aggregations or groupings? Since I'm just looking for a single record with the minimum latitude, ordering by Latitude ASC and limiting to 1 should suffice without needing MIN().  So the final SQL would join both tables on CDSCode, filter where State is CA, order by Latitude, and return the needed fields. I think that's correct. </think>  SELECT s.City AS City, s.School AS SchoolName, f.`Low Grade` AS LowGrade FROM schools s INNER JOIN frpm f ON s.CDSCode = f.CDSCode WHERE s.State = 'CA' ORDER BY s.Latitude ASC LIMIT 1
SELECT `Low Grade`, `High Grade` FROM frpm WHERE CDSCode = (SELECT CDSCode FROM schools ORDER BY ABS(Longitude) DESC LIMIT 1); 
WITH k8_magnet_cities AS (   SELECT s.City, f.Educational Option Type    FROM frpm f   INNER JOIN schools s ON f.CDSCode = s.CDSCode   WHERE f.Magnet = 1 AND f.Low Grade = 'K' AND f.High Grade = '8' ) SELECT COUNT(*) as total_k8_magnet_schools, City, COUNT(City) as number_of_schools_in_city FROM k8_magnet_cities GROUP BY City; 
WITH AllFirstNames AS (   SELECT AdmFName1 AS FirstName, District FROM YourTable   UNION ALL   SELECT AdmFName2, District FROM YourTable WHERE AdmFName2 IS NOT NULL   UNION ALL   SELECT AdmFName3, District FROM YourTable WHERE AdmFName3 IS NOT NULL ), FirstNameCounts AS (   SELECT      FirstName,     COUNT(*) as Count   FROM AllFirstNames   GROUP BY FirstName ) SELECT    A.FirstName,   A.District FROM AllFirstNames A JOIN (   SELECT FirstName, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Count DESC) as RowNum   FROM FirstNameCounts ) B ON A.FirstName = B.FirstName AND B.RowNum <= 2; 
<think> Alright, let me try to figure out how to write this SQL query step by step.  So the user is asking for the "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)" in schools administered by an administrator whose first name is Alusine. They also want the district code of those schools.  First, I need to understand where each piece of information comes from. The percentage they're asking about seems to be a calculated value based on two columns: "Free Meal Count (K-12)" divided by "Enrollment (K-12)" multiplied by 100. So that calculation will be part of the SELECT statement.  Looking at the database schema, I see three relevant tables: frpm, schools, and satscores. Since we're dealing with administrator names, which are in the 'schools' table under AdmFName1, AdmFName2, etc., I'll need to join this table with the frpm table where the percentage is stored.  The district code isn't directly available in the schools table as a separate field; instead, it's part of the District Name and such. Wait, actually, looking back at the 'frpm' table, there's a "District Code" column which is an integer. So I can get the district code from frpm.  So, I'll need to join the schools table with frpm on CDSCode because that's the common key. That way, I can access both the administrator's name and the necessary data for the percentage calculation.  Now, the condition is that the first name of an administrator is Alusine. Since there are multiple admin fields (AdmFName1, AdmFName2, AdmFName3), I should check all three in case any of them have the first name Alusine. So I'll use an OR statement in the WHERE clause to cover each possibility.  Putting it together, my SELECT will calculate the percentage as (FreeMealCount / Enrollment) * 100 and alias it appropriately. I'll select the District Code from frpm. Then, I'll join schools and frpm on CDSCode. The WHERE clause will check if any of AdmFName1, AdmFName2, or AdmFName3 is 'Alusine'.  I should also make sure that Enrollment (K-12) isn't zero to avoid division by zero errors, but the user didn't specify handling that, so maybe it's beyond this query's scope.  So the final SQL would select the calculated percentage and district code where any admin's first name is Alusine. </think>  SELECT CAST((T1.`Free Meal Count (K-12)` / T1.`Enrollment (K-12)`) * 100 AS REAL) AS "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)", T1.`District Code` FROM frpm AS T1 INNER JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode WHERE T2.AdmFName1 = 'Alusine' OR T2.AdmFName2 = 'Alusine' OR T2.AdmFName3 = 'Alusine';
<think> Alright, I need to figure out how to write an SQL query based on the user's question. The question is asking for the administrator's last name who oversees a school with Charter number 40. Additionally, they want the district, county, and school name.  First, looking at the database schema provided, there are three tables: frpm, satscores, and schools. Since we're dealing with charter numbers and administrative details, I'll focus on the 'schools' table because it contains fields like 'CharterNum', which should hold the number 40 in this case.  The 'schools' table has several fields related to administrators' contact information. Specifically, there are multiple admin fields: AdmFName1, AdmLName1, AdmEmail1, and so on up to AdmFName3, etc. Since the question is about the last name of an administrator overseeing the school, I'll need to retrieve AdmLName from one of these admin entries.  Now, how do I know which admin entry to use? The user didn't specify whether it's the first, second, or third admin. In many cases, the primary contact might be Adm1. So, I'll assume that AdmLName1 corresponds to the administrator in charge.  Next, I need to join this information with other details like district and county names. The 'schools' table already contains 'District' and 'County' fields, so those can be directly selected. The school name is also available as the 'School' field.  Putting it all together, the SQL query should select AdmLName1 (administrator's last name), District, County, and School from the schools table where CharterNum is 40.  I need to make sure that I correctly reference the fields. In the schema, 'CharterNum' is a TEXT field, so when comparing it to 40, I should use quotes around the number if necessary, but since it's text, it might be stored as a string. However, looking at the example response, they used CharterNum = '40', which should correctly match.  So, the SQL query will be selecting these four fields from the schools table with the condition that CharterNum equals '40'. </think>  SELECT AdmLName1 AS AdministratorLastname, District, County, School FROM schools WHERE CharterNum = '40'
<think> Alright, I need to help the user by writing an SQL query based on their question. Let me break down what they're asking for and how to approach it.  First, the question is about extracting valid email addresses of school administrators in specific conditions. The schools are located in San Bernardino county, specifically in the "San Bernardino City Unified" city. They opened between 2009 and 2010. Also, the school types should be either Intermediate/Middle Schools or Unified Schools.  From the extra knowledge provided:  - Intermediate/Middle Schools correspond to SOC = '62'. - Unified School corresponds to DOC = '54'. - The opening dates are between 1/1/2009 and 12/31/2010.  I need to look at the database schema. The 'schools' table contains information about each school, including location details (County, District), opening date (OpenDate), SOC code, DOC code, and administrator emails (AdmEmail1, AdmEmail2, AdmEmail3).  So, I'll start by selecting from the schools table where:  - County is 'San Bernardino'. - District is 'San Bernardino City Unified'. Wait, actually, in the schema, there's a 'District' field. But looking back, the user might be referring to both county and city, so maybe the district name is "City of San Bernardino" and the school is part of that district. Hmm, but perhaps I need to check if it's the District or School fields. Wait, in the schema, County, District, and School are separate fields. So 'County' should be 'San Bernardino', and perhaps 'District' is the name of the district, which might be "San Bernardino City Unified". Alternatively, maybe it's stored differently.  Wait, looking at the schools table:  - The County field is TEXT NOT NULL. - District is another field, also TEXT NOT NULL. So to target San Bernardino county, I set County = 'San Bernardino'. For the city, perhaps the district name is "City of San Bernardino" or maybe it's stored as part of the School's info? Wait no, the question says "located in the San Bernardino county, City of San Bernardino City Unified". Hmm, that seems a bit off. Maybe the user meant that the school is in San Bernardino County and within the district named "San Bernardino City Unified"?  Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again:  "administrator of the school located in the San Bernardino county, City of San Bernardino City Unified"  So perhaps it's referring to schools located in both the county and city named "City of San Bernardino", but maybe that's a district name? Or perhaps the County is 'San Bernardino', District is 'City of San Bernardino', and School is part of that.  Wait, looking at the database schema again: The schools table has fields for County, District, and School. So to be in San Bernardino county, set County = 'San Bernardino'. For the district, maybe it's "San Bernardino City Unified". Wait, but the user wrote "City of San Bernardino City Unified", which might be a typo or confusion.  Alternatively, perhaps the 'District' field is "San Bernardino City Unified". So I should set District = 'San Bernardino City Unified'.  Wait, let me think: The question says "located in the San Bernardino county, City of San Bernardino City Unified." That's a bit unclear. Maybe it means the school is located in San Bernardino County and within the district called "City of San Bernardino", but that doesn't make much sense because "San Bernardino City Unified" is a known district name.  Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to say that the schools are located in San Bernardino County and the city is part of the district named "City of San Bernardino". But I'm not sure. For now, I'll proceed by setting County = 'San Bernardino' and District = 'San Bernardino City Unified'.  Next, the school opened between 2009-01-01 and 2010-12-31. So OpenDate >= '2009-01-01' AND OpenDate <= '2010-12-31'.  School types: either Intermediate/Middle Schools (SOC='62') or Unified School (DOC='54'). So the conditions are (SOC = '62' OR DOC = '54').  Wait, but in the schools table, SOC and DOC are separate fields. I think that's correct because:  - SOC is the "type" of school, e.g., 62 for middle schools. - DOC refers to the district organization code; 54 might be for unified school districts.  But wait, according to extra knowledge: Unified School refers to DOC=54, so we need to check if the school's type is either Intermediate (SOC='62') or part of a Unified District (DOC='54'). So combining these with OR.  Putting it all together:  SELECT AdmEmail1, AdmEmail2, AdmEmail3 FROM schools WHERE County = 'San Bernardino' AND District = 'San Bernardino City Unified' AND OpenDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2010-12-31' AND (SOC = '62' OR DOC = '54').  Wait, but the user's question says "City of San Bernardino City Unified". So perhaps I need to adjust District accordingly. Maybe it's actually stored as "San Bernardino City Unified", so District should be that value.  I think that makes sense because "San Bernardino City Unified" is a known school district in California. So, County = 'San Bernardino', District = 'San Bernardino City Unified'.  Wait, but the user wrote "City of San Bernardino City Unified"—that might have been a mistake. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to both county and city as San Bernardino. But perhaps I should just use County and District fields.  So, final SQL: select email columns from schools where County is 'San Bernardino', District is 'San Bernardino City Unified', OpenDate between 2009-2010, and either SOC=62 or DOC=54. </think>  SELECT AdmEmail1, AdmEmail2, AdmEmail3 FROM schools WHERE County = 'San Bernardino' AND District = 'City of San Bernardino' AND (SOC = 62 OR DOC = 54) AND OpenDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2010-12-31';

<think> Okay, I need to figure out how many female customers who were born before 1950 are staying in Sokolov. Let's break this down step by step.  First, the question is asking about clients, so I'll start with the client table. The gender is 'F' for females, so I'll filter on that. Also, their birth year should be before 1950, which means their birth_date needs to be less than '1950-01-01'.   Next, they need to be staying in Sokolov. District names are in the A2 column of the district table. So I have to find the district where A2 is 'Sokolov' and get its district_id.  Now, since each client has a district_id, I can join the client and district tables on that field. But wait, looking at the schema, the client's district_id references the district's district_id, so an INNER JOIN should work there.  I also need to count how many such clients exist. So after joining and filtering, I'll use COUNT(client_id) to get the number.  Putting it all together: Select from client inner join with district where gender is 'F', birth_date < '1950-01-01', and A2 is 'Sokolov'. Then count the clients. </think>  SELECT COUNT(T1.client_id) FROM client AS T1 INNER JOIN district AS T2 ON T1.district_id = T2.district_id WHERE T1.gender = 'F' AND T1.birth_date < '1950-01-01' AND T2.A2 = 'Sokolov'
SELECT account_id FROM trans WHERE date = ( SELECT MIN(date) FROM trans WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', date) = '1995' ) AND STRFTIME('%Y', date) = '1995';

<think> Okay, so I need to find out which client issued their card on '1994/3/3' and get their client ID. Hmm, let's think about how the database is structured.  First, looking at the tables provided, the card table has information about each card, including when it was issued. The card_id is linked to disp_id through the foreign key in the card table. Then, the disp table connects disp_id to client_id through its own foreign keys.  Wait, so the flow would be: from the card issuance date, find the corresponding disp_id, and then use that to get the client_id. But wait, does any card have an issued date of '1994/3/3'? Let me check the data.  Looking at the inserted values in the card table:  - Card 1: issued on '1998-10-16' - Card 2: '1998-03-13' - Card 3: '1995-09-03' - Card 4: '1998-11-26' - Card 5: '1995-04-24'  None of these are on '1994/3/3'. Hmm, that's strange. So there's no card issued on that date in the provided data. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the format. Wait, the dates in the database are in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, so perhaps the question is using a different format, like 'YYYY/MM/DD'.  So the target date is March 3rd, 1994. Let me check again, but as per the data provided, there's no card issued on that exact date. So does that mean the answer is NULL or no client found?  But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the question expects a SQL query regardless of whether such a record exists. So the logic would be: join the card and disp tables to link the issue date to the client_id.  So the steps are:  1. Select from the card table where issued date is '1994-03-03'. 2. For each matching card, get its disp_id. 3. Then, in the disp table, find the corresponding client_id using that disp_id. 4. Finally, retrieve the client_id.  But since there's no such record in the provided data, the query would return nothing. However, the user still wants the SQL statement, so I need to write it correctly regardless of the result.  So the SQL would be:  SELECT T2.client_id FROM card AS T1 INNER JOIN disp AS T2 ON T1.disp_id = T2.disp_id WHERE T1.issue_date = '1994-03-03';  Wait, but looking at the disp table structure, I think it's actually a many-to-many relationship between cards and clients. Wait no, each card has one disp_id, which in turn links to one client.  But wait, looking back, the disp table doesn't have an issue_date field. Oh wait, no, the card table has 'issued' as a date column. So I can directly filter on that.  Wait, the card table's structure is: trans_id, account_id, date, type, etc., but for the card table, it's:  card_id, disp_id, issue_date, ...  Wait, actually, looking at the schema provided earlier:  CREATE TABLE card (     card_id INTEGER,     disp_id INTEGER,     issue_date DATE,     ... );  So yes, the card table has an 'issue_date' field. So the query is correct.  But in the data given, there are no cards issued on 1994-03-03, so the result would be empty. But since the question asks for the SQL, that's what I'll provide. </think>  SELECT T.client_id FROM disp AS T INNER JOIN card AS C ON T.disp_id = C.disp_id WHERE C.issue_date = '1994-03-03'
SELECT T1.date  FROM account T1  WHERE T1.account_id = (     SELECT T2.account_id      FROM trans T2      WHERE T2.amount = 840 AND T2.date = '1998-10-14' ); 
SELECT T1.district_id FROM account AS T1 JOIN loan AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id WHERE T2.date = '1994-08-25';
